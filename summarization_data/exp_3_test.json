She was afebrile with normal vital signs through her course. She had tenderness in the RLQ. CT scan showed extensive inflammatory and phlegmonous changes in the right lower abdomen without evidence of a drainable abscess. The differential diagnosis included appendicitis/appendiceal rupture and Crohn's flare. She was treated conservatively, initially with IV Unasyn, pain management, and nothing by mouth. Her diet was advanced as tolerated to a regular diet; however, she did not tolerate a regular diet well as it caused increased abdominal pain. In consultation with the gastroenterology service, she was placed on liquid diet including Ensure and was advised to continue it for two weeks. Once tolerating liquids, she was transitioned to oral Augmentin for a total antibiotic course of 14 days (final dose on ___ and pain management with oral tramadol and acetaminophen.

{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: SUMMARY: Ms. ___ is a ___ woman with history of HTN, IDDMII c/b gastroparesis, peripheral neuropathy, GERD, constipation, cholelithiasis, history of abdominal necrotizing fasciitis now presenting with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting consistent with prior gastroparesis flares. HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM: # Gastroparesis flare The patient presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, suspected due to flare of gastroparesis. Other possible contributions including constipation and GERD. Patient has history of cholelithiasis, but pain atypical of biliary colic. Lipase within normal limits. KUB without acute process. She improved with conservative/supportive treatment including bowel rest with slow advancement of diet, pain medications (initially IV morphine, then oxycodone/APAP/ibuprofen), and antiemetics (lorazepam due to prolonged QTc). She improved with these measure and was tolerating a regular diet and pain-free at the time of discharge. # IDDMI # Hyperglycemia: Last A1c 7.2% on ___. Home regimen is Levemir 14 units Qam and 12 units QPM. She was treated with a reduced dose of her insulin while not tolerating PO. Her home regimen was resumed on discharge as she was eating and drinking normally. # Dysuria Patient recently completed course of antibiotics for UTI, but reported ongoing dysuria. Repeat UA was not consistent with UTI. # Acute kidney injury (resolved with IV fluids) Pre-renal azotemia in setting of poor oral intake and vomiting. # Prolonged QTc Likely due to medication effect from multiple Qt prolonging medications including metoclopramide and citalopram. Her QTc improved after holding these meds. On discharge, her citalopram was changed to sertraline and her metoclopramide was held. # Leukocytosis (resolved after IV fluids): Likely due to hemoconcentration. No fevers. Patient was recently treated for urinary tract infection. CHRONIC/STABLE PROBLEMS: # Hypertension: - Not on any agents # GERD: - PO famotidine and omeprazole # Anemia: Hb was normal in setting of hemoconcentration on admission. H/H was trended. # Post-partum depression. She was recently started on citalopram which was held on admission due to prolonged QTc. Citalopram was changed to sertaline on discharge. >30 minutes spent on complex discharge", "summary": "You were admitted to the hospital for abdominal pain, nausea, and inability to take in oral liquids/food due to a gastroparesis flare. Maybe this was triggered by your recent urinary tract infection. You were treated with supportive care (bowel rest, anti-nausea medicines, pain medicines) and your symptoms improved. You also had some kidney injury due to dehydration which resolved with IV fluids. You had a segment of your EKG (heart electrical conduction) that was slightly prolonged due to the effect of multiple medications you were taking. This can be dangerous because it can cause a fatal rhythm problem in your heart."}

{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: ___ is a ___ female with AML status post a core transplantation on ___ transferred for ___ ___ with fevers, chills, and rigors, and GNR bacteremia. 1. E. coli Bacteremia: transferred from outside hospital with + blood cultures from ___ that was later speciated as e. coli (resistant to ampicillin, cefazolin and bactrim). The most likely etiology of bacteremia was a UTI, given initial sx of dysuria and + urinalysis. There was no evidence of pyelonephritis such as flank pain/ CVA tenderness or WBC casts on urinalysis. CXR also showed no evidence of pneumonia. Given immunosuppression and history of e.coli UTIs sensitive to cefepime, the patient was initially placed on cefepime while awaiting culture results. Given persistent high grade fevers and SIRS like physiology with tachycardia and leukocytosis, the patient was also initially ordered to receive vancomycin. However 15 minutes into vancomycin infusion, she developed severe pruritis and antibiotics were stopped. At this time, final speciation of blood culture from the OSH was received and the need for gram positive coverage was felt to be unnecessary. On ___, the patient was noted to have relative eosinophilia and new rash (see below), so cefepime was switched to aztreonam. Surveillance blood and urine cultures drawn on admission remained negative. Patient was treated with IV antibiotics as above and supportively with IV fluids and acetaminophen as needed. Once patient had been afebrile for > 48 hrs, she was started on PO ciprofloxacin. Discharged with instructions to complete a two week course of antibiotics from first negative blood culture on ___. Of note, initial CXR showed new cardiomegaly, although because it was a portable film, accurate heart size could not be fully assessed. Given the history of cardiotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, an ECHO was done to further evaluate. ECHO showed no new abnormalities or depressed cardiac function. 2. Eosinophilia: On ___ patient was noted to have a new diffuse macular- papular rash and eosinophilia in context of being on cefepime and having a pruritic reaction to the initial infusion of vancomycin. Although the patient has received both of these antibiotics in the past without complications, there was concern for an allergic reaction so cefepime was switched to aztreonam and vancomycin was discontinued. The patient also complained of several episodes of loose stool, and given history of cord transplantation there was concern for stage 2 GVHD. With lack of recent risk factors, an infectious etiology for eosinophilia was thought to be unlikely. A limited evaluation for parasitic infection returned negative. Eosinophilia increased from 5% to 17% on ___ and rash did not clinically improve. On ___, the patient was started on an empiric course of Prednisone 20mg with expected resolution of eosinophilia. Discharged with short taper of steroids, with the instruction to maintain a high suspicion for any additional signs of GVHD. 3. AML s/p transplant: Questionable stage 2 GVHD as above.

Pt reports her cough has improved overall since last hospitalization and no fever. She reliably completed her antibiotic course. #Post-infectious cough: Patient reported a cough since previous admission productive of brown, non-bloody sputum. There were no concerns for active infection, given that the patient was afebrile throughout admission, denied shortness of breath, and maintained good O2 sats. Also no concern for HF, despite minor pulmonary vasculature prominence on CXR and crackles on exam, but given no CHF sxs, peripheral edema, or JVD elevation, this is ___ explained by resolving CAP. Her symptoms were treated with her home medications (albuterol inhaler and guaifenesin), as well as tessalon perles, and duonebs, and improved somewhat.

The fluid collection was compressing the R common femoral causing a DVT to form. The patient was started on IV vanc and unasyn. The pt was started on a heparin drip for the DVT. She was transitioned to lovenox during her stay and will need 3 months of lovenox total. Before draining the fluid collection, extensive discussions were made between several teams. Ultimately it was decided to not pursue ppx IVC filter placement before draining the collection. There was concern for PEs after the compression resolved. The patient was made aware of the team's thoughts as well as the risks of doing the procedure and risks by not doing the procedure. She was alright with pursuing the drainage w/o the IVC filter placement. The collection was drained via CT guidance by ___. 10cc were initially drained and a pigtail was left ___ place to continue draining the collection. The culture grew GBS.

Exam is notable for chorea-like movements in the bilateral face, arms and legs with no associated weakness or sensory loss. NCHCT shows bilateral thalamic hypodensities which were concerning for infarcts. . #Dyskinesia consistent with athetosis or chorea . MRI showed no acute strokes but did show bilateral thalamic hyperintensities on Flair that were not contrast enhancing. Given the location of these findings, they were thought to consistent with the cause of her dyskinesias. Her dyskinesias improved and appeared resolved at the time of discharge. She appeared well and at her baseline throughout the entire admission aside from hypertension. Differential diagnosis for her imaging findings initially included Wilsons, carbon monoxide poisoning, Wernickes, lymphoma, viral etiologies (including flaviviruses: ___ encephalitis, ___ virus), PRES, osmotic demyelination, Sjogrens, ADEM, and atypical MS. ___ causes of her imaging findings that were thought to be less likely were hypoxic injury as there was no clear episode of hypotension or hypoxemia, though these both could have occurred intraoperatively. MRI with contrast was negative for venous sinus thrombosis which could also cause these findings. . She underwent lumbar puncture that had a very benign profile with 0 WBC and 0 RBC in tube 1.

{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: #NARCOTICS ISSUES: She continually tried to negotiate for higher doses of narcotics while on service without any objective evidence for abdominal pain. Of note, records obtained from the MA narcotic rx database show that the patient has been given 48 different prescriptions for various narcotic pain medications by 21 different providers over the past 12 months. The last 2 months show 12 rx from multiple providers, often at the same ___. Rx include methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone/contin and percocet. She tested negative for methadone and oxycodone in house. Prior to being confronted with this information, she declined receiving any rx for narcotics as an outpatient other than for a car accident in ___, and declined taking narcotics regularly. After confronting her, she admitted to getting rx from multiple providers but stated that \"she forgot\". We discussed our concern for narcotics addiction/abuse with the patient. We placed calls to many of her providers, who were unaware of the multiple rx. We also noted that she received multiple benzo rx from different providers. We were unable to contact her PCP as her PCP's office # has been disconnected at the time of this d/c summary. Her surgeon states that the patient should only be receiving any narcotic medication from her pain clinic (although the MA rx database showed she received rx from 2 different pain clinics). Any future encounters for pain without objective evidence should be cautiously treated. #Diarrhea: Pt. has a history of c dif infections, per report, and presented with reports of watery diarrhea for three days and concern for reinfection. She was seen at ___ ___ and empirically prescribed oral flagyl, although she was unable to provide a stool sample. On this admission patient reported continuing diarrhea since being seen at ___, with worsening abdominal pain. However in the hospital she never had diarrhea, no leukocytosis and no c/f colitis on CT imaging. Eventual stool sample was given which was neg for cdiff; flagyl stopped. #Abdominal pain: Pt presented with RLQ and epigastric pain in the context of ___ days watery diarrhea. She has a history of multiple abdominal surgeries and c dif infections. A CT abdomen was negative for any acute abdominal process, and her white blood cell count, lactate, and electrolytes were within normal limits. She remained afebrile with normal vitals throughout her hospital stay. She was started on dilaudid 1 mg IV Q3H:PRN pain and subsequently switched to oral oxycodone. Surgery was consulted in the ED and did not feel her abdominal pain was related to any acute surgical issue. They recommended follow up with her bariatric surgeon. The pt requested transfer multiple times to ___, per her report at the request of her surgeon; after calling her surgeon, we discovered the patient had never spoken w her, and she declined transfer. After declining escalation of narcotics, she immediately felt better and wanted to be discharged. TRANSITIONAL ISSUSES -narcotic rx concern: patient has history of narcotic and benzo medication rx from many providers on ___ monthly basis without utox positivity. Would recommend hesitant rx of narcotics or benzos if presents with pain without objective evidence.", "summary": "You were admitted with abdominal pain and diarrhea. We were concerned about a C. diff. infection given your prior infections and your recent hospital visit, where you were started on oral flagyl to treat a possible infection. We treated a possible C. diff. infection by giving you oral flagyl. We were not able to send a stool sample in the hospital initially because you were not having diarrhea, so we could not confirm the infection. Once we were able to get a stool sample it was sent and you were found not to have a C. diff. infection. Your oral flagyl was discontinued. We also gave you pain medications. A CT scan of your abdomen was reassuring. It showed that your colon and pancreas were normal. There were no signs of infections or inflammation on the scan. Our surgery team evaluated you in the emergency department and recommended that you follow up with your bariatric surgeon."}

NCSE was suspected and she was given LZP immediately. Nystagmus continued intermittently despite 2mg LZP and she was given another 2mg after ___ minutes. She required intubation shortly thereafter because of airway protection (dropping SaO2 to ___, secretional) and was started on propofol which also had the effect of breaking her status (which by that point had progressed to hand shaking). Home Keppra dose was increased from 1000 mg BID to ___ BID ___ given in ED) with proposal. Hospital Course: ___ was admitted to the ICU in guarded condition. EEG monitoring was initiated after receiving lorazepam, levetiracetam and propofol; the tracing showed burst suppression with no evidence of electrographic seizures. She remained electrographically and clinically free of seizures. A repeat workup to determine the etiology of her seizures was conducted and was notable for MRI with two small (3-mm) foci of diffusion restriction consistent with stroke; cytology was negative and TB PCR is pending. Her strokes were thought to be secondary to her known atrial fibrillation, with minimal clinical significance. No new etiology of her seizures was identified and the most likely cause remains underlying small vessel disease with residual abnormalities characterized on MRI. Her hospital course was complicated by a failure to wean from the ventilator. Bronchoscopy was performed and secretions were concerning for pneumonia. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed and cultures were positive for MRSA. She underwent a course of treatment for MRSA pneumonia. Her failure to wean was attributed to her pneumonia as well as scarring given her history of pulmonary tuberculosis. With treatment of her pneumonia she was able to wean from the ventilator. Her oxygen requirement resolved. On admission, her troponins were mildly elevated but plateaued at 0.14. This was attributed to strain in the context of seizure and acute medical illness. No intervention was performed. For her atrial fibrillation, her coumadin was held in anticipation of lumbar puncture and she was started on a heparin drip. Her anticogaulation was subsequently switched to fondiparinux given concern for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. HIT antibodies were sent and were negative. Her heparin was restarted and her platelet count recovered without intervention. Her coumadin was restarted. She was transitioned to a lovenox bridge in preparation for discharge. She was evaluated by physical therapy who saw that she was decondittioned and recommended rehabilitation versus home with 24 hour supervision. The patient and her family strongly preferred to go home with 24 hour rehabilitation and home physical therapy. CT chest showed an incidental finding of soft tissue thickening in the abdomen, concerning for possible recurrence of GI lymphoma. Her recent lymphoma recurrence had been located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, per discussion with her oncologist's fellow, the known location of cancer was consistent with these new findings. She should follow up with her oncologist on discharge.", "summary": "You were admitted to the hospital because you were having a seizure. We increased the dose of your anti-seizure medication, Keppra, and you did not have any more seizures. While you were here, we did more tests to investigate the cause of your seizures, including an MRI of your brain. There was no sign of an infection of your nervous system. Your MRI did show two very small strokes which we believe were due to your atrial fibrillation. We do not think that this was the cause of your seizures. It is important that you continue to take the coumadin to reduce the likelihood of any further strokes. While you were here you were found to have a pneumonia. You had a bronchoscopy to look at your lungs. We treated you with antibiotics for your pneumonia. This pneumonia made it difficult for you to come off the ventilator. You were evaluated by physical therapy who noticed that you were very weak from your stay in the hospital. We recommended that you continue to receive physical therapy, and that you will need 24-hour assistance while you are getting back on your feet. Please arrange for home physical therapy."}

It was felt to most likely be caused by a viral gastroenteritis. Given his concurrent hypertension, he underwent head CT that showed ventriculomegaly and MRI was recommended. MRI preliminarily showed enlarged ventricles but no signs of hydrocephalus and no other acute process or signs of metastatic disease in the brain. He also had small chronic small vessel disease and he was advised to limit his alcohol use given these findings. LP was considered to completely rule out leptomeningeal involvement but given the resolution of his symptoms and in discussion with his primary oncologist, this was not pursued. # Hypertension: His blood pressure was significantly elevated to 180/100's on admission and was very responsive to low doses of oral labetalol. He remained mildly hypertension (BP ___ during admission and was started on low dose lisinopril. He should have BP rechecked and electrolytes checked by his PCP and an appointment was arranged for him. # Transaminitis: AST and ALT mildly elevated on admission and remained mildly elevated.

{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: ___ male with an extensive peripheral vascular surgical history including a failed left fem pop bypass with PTFE culminating in a left above knee amputation. After his amputation he was noted to have a draining sinus from his amp site and it was eventually found that his PTFE graft was infected. He went to the OR and the majority of the PTFE graft was taken out however a small cuff of graft was left in place at the proximal anastomosis of the groin. Since that operation he has had episodes of bleeding, hematoma, and infection in the left groin. He presented to the emergency room with complaints of spontaneous bleeding from the left groin. He was then taken to the OR for exploration. During the operation cultures were obtained then the groin was opened and washed out. There was no signs of gross infection. The residual PTFE graft was oversewn to stop the bleeding and a sartorius muscle flap was placed over the exposed graft to reduce infection risk. A VAC dressing was then placed. For details of the procedure, please see the surgeon's operative note. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications and was brought to the post-anesthesia care unit in stable condition. After a brief stay, the patient was transferred to the vascular surgery floor where he remained through the rest of the hospitalization. His wound vac was changed on POD3 and healthy granulation tissue was noted. He was then switched to a wet-to-dry dressing in preparation for discharge to rehab, where a wound vac will again be placed. Infectious Disease was consulted and based on the culture data and sensitivities recommended meropenem while inpatient and discharge on IV Ertapenem 1g q24 for 6 weeks, followed by chronic suppressive oral antibiotics, the course of which will be determined on outpatient OPAT follow-up. He remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course, and his WBC remained <10. The patient worked with Physical therapy throughout his hospital course, which recommended rehab. He did have some difficulty with voiding after the Foley was removed, for which his Flomax was increased to 0.8 qhs. He remained A&OX3 and hemodynamically stable throughout his course. On POD 4, the patient was deemed ready for discharge to rehab. He was able to tolerate a regular diet, work with physical therapy, void without issues, and pain was controlled on oral medications alone. He was deemed ready for discharge, and was given the appropriate discharge and follow-up instructions. He will be discharged on IV Ertapenem 1g q24 daily for 6 weeks, he will continue his home dose of Apixaban 5mg BID for history of DVT, he will continue aspirin 81mg daily lifelong, and he will have Tylenol and tramadol for pain control. He will be discharged to rehab for IV antibiotics, wound vac care (black foam at 125mmHg, change every 3 days), and physical therapy. The patient will have appointments set up for Infectious disease, and will follow-up with Vascular surgery in 2 weeks.", "summary": "You were admitted to the hospital secondary to bleeding from your left groin. Because you have had extensive surgery to the left groin with synthetic graft in the area, we were very concerned that this bleeding was secondary to infection. There was continued oozing so you were taken to the OR for exploration of the left groin. We obtained cultures from the wound in the OR after we washed out the left groin, oversewed the residual graft to stop the bleeding, and covered the area with a muscle flap and placed a VAC to improve healing and reduce the risk of further infection. The infectious disease team was consulted and recommended IV ertapenem 1g q24 for 6 weeks followed by oral suppressive antibiotics. They based this recommendation on the micro-organisms growing from your wound and sensitivities demonstrated."}

Workup has been notable for imaging of spine w enhancing cauda equina nerve roots and lumbar disc herniation. Of note, further review of the imaging by neuroradiology was somewhat inconclusive, and it is unclear if there truly was nerve root enhancement, or possibly just signal from nearby veins. EMG revealed axon loss bilaterally in L3-L4 region without evidence of demyelination. In addition, she has a pro-thrombotic state with multiple DVTs and pulmonary embolism on her imaging, for which we started heparin anticoagulation. During her hospitalization, she underwent LP for diagnostic workup of her cauda equina enhancement, after which she developed an epidural hematoma. She had an IVC filter placed successfully while anticoagulation was held for her surgical intervention. She underwent epidural hematoma evacuation, L3-L5 lumbar decompression, and L4 lumbar laminectomy.

{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: ___ year old female with hx of COPD/restrictive lung disease, T1-T2 paraplegia s/p MVA with chronic pain, and recent history of recurrent pneumonias who presents w/ SOB and increased oxygen requirement with CXR concerning for another recurrence of PNA as well as known ESBL UTI. . ACTIVE ISSUES . #. Shortness of breath and O2 requirement: Her decreased neuromuscular strength and inability to clear her secretions could be underlying cause for recurrent infections, despite frequent chest physiotherapy. However, it was considered that this exacerbation may not be infectious, but with the development of hypotension and her O2 requirement, we decided to start broad-spectrum antibiotics initially. CTA chest showed some filling defects in left upper and lower pulmonary vessels (similar to prior) with a new ground-glass opacity on the left suggesting infection. Given her improved clinical status, baseline O2 requirement, lack of fever or leukocytosis, we felt comfortable discontinuing her broad-coverage antibiotics for healthcare associated pneumonia coverage despite this radiological finding. She was continued on albuterol/ipratropium nebs as needed. Her PCA continued to perform chest ___ on her while in house and she did begin to mobilize her secretions. She was discharged off antibiotics. #. CoNS in blood cultures: Blood cultures taken from the PICC line upon admission grew caogulase negative S. aureus. We initially covered with Vancomycin and pulled the PICC line until further data was available. When cultures were repeated, only those from ___ were positive, representing a likely contaminant. The PICC line tip culture itself did not grow anything. She remained afebrile and did not show any systemic signs of infection. . #. Recurrent UTIs: She was admitted on ertapenem for treatment of an ESBL Klebsiella Urine culture showed no growth. Given her spinal cord injury and frequent straight caths, she is prone to UTIs but will not be traditionally symptomatic. She was changed to meropenem on admission. LFTs were checked, given incidence of LFT abnormalities on the penems. A Foley catheter was placed despite the UTI because she normally gets straight catheterized every ___ hours and that would not have been possible on the general medicine floor. She finished a 7-day antibiotic course while in house and was discharged off all antibiotics. . # CTA findings: Soft tissue mass in the azygoesophageal recess (stable since ___ and right hilar LAD (increased since prior study) may need further evaluation with MRI. Please see full CTA report for more details. If MRI is not done, a follow-up contrast-enhanced CT would be recommended in 3 months to ensure this LAD is indeed reactive. These are recommendations from Radiology. . INACTIVE ISSUES . #. T1-T2 paraplegia with chronic pain: Patient does complain of some pain in her legs, but is on a home regimen that seems to work quite well for her. With any sedating pain regimen, there is always a concern for CO2 retention/slowed respiratory rate. She was perfectly stable on her pain regimen without any changes in mental status or breathing pattern. She was continued on baclofen, methadone, oxycodone, pregabalin and a bowel regimen of PEG and Dulcolax. Oxybutynin was continued for urinary retention. . #. Hypothyroidism: TSH 10 on last check in ___, resulting in an increase of her levothyroxine dosing. She was continued on levothyroxine at 88mcg daily. . #. Normocytic anemia: At baseline, no evidence of active bleeding. Known anemia of chronic disease. Her Hct was stable in house. .

She called her PCP office several time and was yelling profanities at the office staff, at our nursing staff and at me personally. She became very distruptive to the medical floor and refused examination. She also called ___ several time and code purple was activated on one ocassion. Psychiatry was reconsulted for consideration of psychiatric admission. It was initially difficult to differentiate delirium from acute psychiatric reaction and psychosis, however, it became clear that her agitation and paranoia are from psychiatric reaction. This was ocnfirmed by an EEG which showed no evidence of metabolic or toxic encephalopathy. In addition, repeat CXR and blood tests were all OK. Her exam (refused many times) did not indicate a ___ medical situation. She was placed on antipsychotic medications and 1:1 sitter. Of note, during admission, social work and case management worked on getting her into rehabilitation. This was also at the recommendation of her PCP. There were concerns regarding care at home, though she does have a home health aid. However, because of her decompensated psychiatric situation, she requires an inpatient psychiatric admission. The Medical consult team should be available if any of her chronic medical situations decompensate. We had a meeting with her sister who came from ___ regarding plan of care. The meeting was on ___ and took 45 minutes regarding plan of care and prognosis. Her sister is not her HCP (her home aid is her HCP!). In regards to other medical problems: 1-Left Ulnar Collateral Ligament Sprain/Osteophyte Fracture: She was assessed by hand surgery and a cast was placed. However, she demanded it be taken off. The cast was re-adjusted to no avail. She understood the risks of removing the cast. OT was consulted and changed her cast to a fabricated splint with better effect. She needs to be seen in Hand Surgery Clinic in ___ weeks. 2-Chronic systolic CHF: She was not found to be volume overloaded. Her Lasix was initially held given renal failure. She remained euvolemic and her lasix was restarted on ___. 3-Non-Hodgkins lymphoma: She has follow up with Hemetology/Oncology arranged as outpatient. She missed the appointment because of her psychiatric situation. She would need re-appointment once she is discharged to resume care.

Patient presents to the hospital with similar symptoms that brought her into the hospital in ___. During that prior hospital course, she received cardiac catheterization which showed similar CAD as prior catheterization, and no intervention was done. However, this time the chest discomfort is more centrally located. She ruled out for MI with negative cardiac biomarkers x3 and essentially unchanged EKG. She did not tolerate nitroglycerin, and heparin gtt was thought not to be necessary given the atypical nature of her symptoms. She received morphine and home pain medication with minimal alleviation of her symptoms. The nuclear stress test showed no EKG changes and the perfusion study also showed no defect. Her estimated stress LVEF is slightly lower than the prior echo estimation, but this is somewhat expected given the difference in modality. It is likely that her symptoms is related to GI etiology, such as GERD and esophogeal spasm. She was initiated with a H2 blocker. An endoscopy was recommended to patient, and she decided to have this done in the outpatient basis with her primary care physician. Other possible cause could be small vessel disease, which may be augmented with calcium channel blockers or increase Imdur dose, if her HR and BP tolerates. She was discharged on home medication with the addition of H2 blocker. This can be followed up by patient's primary care physician and her cardiologist. 2.

Also, pain was reproducible on exam, although her history and exam were quite variable from examiner to examiner. Patient was able to fall asleep despite complaints of ongoing pain. She was unable to perform nuclear stress testing due to inability to lay still on her back, which according to the patient is a chronic problem for her. She was also unable to cooperate with a non-imaging exercise stress test. Since ischemia was unlikely given ongoing chest pain without evidence of infarction, other pharmacological stress testing or imaging modalities were not pursued. An echocardiogram was obtained which was unrevealing for any acute wall motion abnormalities but did note grade I diastolic dysfunction. A GI cocktail and PPI did not improve the pain. She was treated with standing Tylenol and ibuprofen for presumed costochondritis. A subclinical seizure leading to fall was a possibility, but CK's were not elevated and pt could not remember any such episode. Patient also had no evidence for pulmonary embolus or aortic dissection by ___ angiogram. The radiology department there felt the 3.9cm ectasia of the ascending aorta seemed chronic and stable and was very unlikely to be causing any of her symptoms.

You did have an echocardiogram which did not reveal any acute cardiac pathology. Although we are not certain what the cause of your pain is, it is most likely musculoskeletal given that your whole body hurts, and we could reproduce the pain by examining you. The pain is not related to your heart, lungs or major blood vessels in your chest. We incidentally found a small widening of your aorta which is not causing your pain, but it should be monitored with another CT scan to make sure it is not getting bigger. We also found very few atypical blood cells on your bloodwork. These are also not the cause of your pain, but a repeat blood test can be performed as an outpatient to make sure they resolve.

{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: Mr ___ was a ___ male with decompensated hepatitis C virus infection and resultant cirrhosis with portal hypertension, ascites and peripheral edema (s/p TIPS) who was awaiting transplant. He presented from ___ for rising Bilirubin in the setting of multiple evolving medical problems. During this hospitalization patient's end stage liver disease continued to decompensate and his course was further complicated by development of hepatorenal syndrome, persistent leukocystosis, and eventually development of sepsis which led to his death. Below is a brief outline of some of the major medical issues that affected his course. #) End Stage Liver Disease: Secondary to hepatitis C cirrhosis. Patient had severe decompensation of liver disease over the course of this hospitalization. Encephalopathy worsened likely given an underlying infection of unclear source in spite of being on broad antibiotic coverage for much of his hospitalization. Bilirubin continued to trend up. He underwent MRCP that did not indicate any obstructing stones though he was noted to have a large pancreatic pseudocyst. Course also complicated by the development of hepatorenal syndrome eventually requiring dialysis. By the end of patient's hospitalization MELD score was greater than 40. Patient required a liver transplant, however, transplant was no longer an option when patient's white count began to rise and it was determined by abdominal ultrasound that he was found to have multiple liver lesions that appeared to be abscesses. Patient's family agreed to make him DNR/DNI given his poor prognosis. #) Persistent Leukocytosis: WBC count elevated for most of this admission. He was found to have a blood culture positive for Coagulase Negative Staph on ___ and was treated with a course of Vancomycin. He had many negative urine, stool, peritoneal cultures, and subsequent blood cultures that were negative. Patient was on broad coverage antibiotics including vancomycin, meropenem and micafungin for a significant portion of his hospitalization. He was only noted to be febrile sporadically. The infectious disease team, who followed the patient, had a high level of suspicion that the patient's pancreatic pseudocyst could have been infected. Towards the end of the ___ hospital course his white count rose precipitously as high as 48. As explained above, an ultrasound of his liver demonstrated multiple liver lesions that may have been abscesses. #) Hepatorenal Syndrome: Patient course was complicated by the development of hepatorenal syndrome. Creatinine initially responded to albumin and fluids but then began to increase precipitously and it was at this point that octreotide and midodrine were initiated. Hemodialysis was eventually initiated. Patient had been listed for a kidney transplant. #) Bullous disorder of unclear etiology: The patient presented with a bullous skin lesions on the trunk and lower legs felt by dermatology to be most consistent with drug-induced bullous pemphigoid. He was s/p extended stay in the ___ burn unit for treatment of these lesions. Though the patient had an exposure to chloroquine prior to admission the dermatology team did not feel that these lesions were completely consistent with a chloroquine bullous reaction. They also considered lasix as a potential cause. Lesions remained stable with wound care and treatment with clobetasol. Patient did have a re-exposure to lasix on ___ and subsequently developed a morbiliform drug hypersensitivity reaction on the skin with no worsening of the bullous eruption. This new eruption was mainly managed with medication for pruritus.", "summary": "The patient was admitted for management of his end stage liver disease secondary to hepatitis C. During this admission he was also evaluated for bullous skin lesions that could be secondary to chloroquine ingestion. His hospitalization was also complicated by development of hepatorenal syndrome. He was being considered for liver transplantation until he began to develop sepsis. Cultures including stool and urine remained negative though patient had a known pseudocyst that may have ultimately been the source of infection. Prior to his death patient was noted to have diffuse cystic lesions throughout his liver that were likely abscesses. Given his critical condition his family decided to make DNR/DNI though antibiotics were continued. Patient was pronounced dead during the hospitalization."}

You will require close monitoring of your fluid status and kidney function."}
{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o female with CAD, CHF, CKD, and DM2 who was admitted for hyponatremia. # Hyponatremia/Polydipsia: Etiology of hyponatremia secondary to polydipsia as the patient admitted to drinking excess water. She is afraid she will need dialysis in the future, therefore drinks water whenever she feels her urine output is not adequate. This is supported by dilute urine osmolality on admission (144). The patient was placed on fluid restriction of 1.5L and her sodium trended to normal upon discharge. Patient also has an element of volume overload secondary to systolic CHF. Therefore, torsemide was restarted at her previous dose (5mg). The patient was informed that her kidney function is stable, and she should continue with 2L fluid restriction. # Hyperkalemia: K+ peaked at 5.6 during this admission. EKG did not have any hyperacute T waves. Per OMR, the patient may type IV distal RTA. This is evidenced by history of hyperkalemia as well as urine pH >5. Irbesartan was decreased by half to prevent further episodes of hyperkalemia. The patient was also restarted on torsemide. # Systolic CHF: Secondary to coronary artery disease. Repeat echo with EF 50-55%, though EF was 34% on perfusion stress test. BNP was elevated, though at baseline. Patient appeared asymptomatic and compensated, though volume status was difficult to assess due to body habitus. The patient's carvedilol was increased to 25mg BID as she was hypertensive. Irbesartan dose was also decreased in half. Patient was restarted on torsemide 5mg (previous home dose). # Coronary artery disease: The patient had one episode of chest pain with radiation down her left arm. EKG and troponins were negative. Echocardiogram showed decreased EF and new hypokinesis in the inferior walls. Stress test did not produce angina or EKG changes. Perfusion stress test was unremarkable. The patient was continued on aspirin and simvastatin. Cardiology was consulted and felt patient may have an element of demand ischemia in the setting of hypertension. Therefore, carvedilol dose was increased to 25mg BID. Patient was also started on imdur 30mg. # Hypertension: Patient was hypertensive with SBP up to 180s. Therefore carvedilol dose was increased to 25mg BID. Irbesartan was decreased to 37.5mg due to hyprekalemia. Imdur 30mg was also started. # Chronic Kidney Disease Stage III: The patient's baseline Cr is 1.4, though ranges from 1.3-1.6. As above, counseled patient that her Cr has remained stable and we don't anticipate her needing dialysis in the near future. # DM Type II on insulin: HbA1c 6.7 in ___. The patient only takes glargine when her FSBG is >200. The patient's sugars were well controlled and she never required insulin. # Anemia of chronic disease: H/H remained stable. She was continued on ferrous sulfate. # Crohn's Disease: The patient was continued on sulfasalazine and ciprofloxacin. # Peptic ulcer disease: Patient was continued on omeprazole. # Alcoholic cirrhosis: No evidence of decompensation. Last EGD ___ with no evidence varices. # Chronic pancreatitis: Continued on creon. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - The patient will follow up with Cardiology. - Please repeat Chem 7 at ___ appointment. - Encourage patient to adhere to 2L fluid restriction. - Carvedilol dose increased to 25mg BID. - Patient started on imdur 30mg as patient remained hypertensive. - Irbesartan dose decreased to 37.5mg due to hyperkalemia, and patient has a history of type IV renal tubular acidosis. - Patient restarted on torsemide 5mg. - Consider decreasing aspirin dose to 81mg.", "summary": "As you recall, you were admitted and your sodium was found to be low. Your low sodium is due to your excess water intake. Your kidney function tests have been stable, therefore we do not anticipate you needing dialysis in the near future. Please limit your water intake to 2L per day (equivalent to the size of one large soda bottle). As discussed, excess water will cause your sodium to be low, which can be dangerous. It can also cause your heart function to worsen. You also had some chest pain in the hospital. EKGs and lab tests indicate no acute damage to your heart. You had an echocardiogram, which showed your heart function is decreased from prior tests. Because of this, we increased the dose of carvedilol and started you on a new blood pressure medication called Imdur. Your irbesartan dose was decreased by half to prevent your potassium too be high. We also restarted you on torsemide to decrease swelling in your legs."}

Noted by CNA and by patient to have increased purulence and erythema which prompted presentation. X-ray on admission notable for soft tissue gas and swelling along posterior elbow w/o signs of osteomyelitis. He was seen by Orthopedics, and follows with Dr. ___ as outpatient. After multiple discussions with Orthopedics, patient chose to decline surgery which would have consisted of definitive operation including excision of sinus tract and closure with a flap. Patient did not undergo bone biopsy as it was felt that to clear the infection he would need definitive surgical treatment, rather than just a wash out, and this would not be consistent with his goals of care as above. He tolerated antibiotic treatment well, and ultimately in conjunction with Orthopedics, decided to defer any operative intervention. He needs to have rigorous wound care follow-up and should wear a new splint on his elbow when sleeping per Orthopedics to help protect the area. # Anemia: Mild anemia, unclear baseline.

Patient initially was brought to the emergency department at ___ by EMS following an episode of unresponsiveness to voice or touch, but without rhythmic movements of the eyes, face, or limbs. While in the emergency department, she remained in this state but would resist examination, and was unable to cooperate with a CT scan. She was given a total of 4 mg IM lorazepam and 10 mg IM haloperidol in the emergency room and was minimally reactive and unable to provide history or participate in physical exam upon initial consultation. Patient was subsequently hospitalized for further evaluation. A non-contrast head CT showed slightly enlarged ventricles but was otherwise unremarkable. CXR was unremarkable. Laboratory studies did not demonstrate any toxic, metabolic, or infectious cause. The next morning, the patient was alert and oriented to person, place, month and year, and situation. Her sister and the patient both reported that she was back to her neurological baseline. Patient's physical exam was non-focal, and her laboratory studies continued to be unremarkable. cvEEG showed a normal background and no epileptiform activity. MRI w/wo contrast did not show acute intracranial abnoramility or other structural or vascular cause of her presenting symptoms. Patient did acknowledge recent depressive symptoms due to considerable recent stress financially and physically at work, for which a social work consult was obtained. She denies desire to self harm, suicidal ideation, homicidal ideation, and audiovisual hallucinations. Upon further discussion with social work, it was discovered she has experienced significant past trauma and non-consensual sexual encounters. Social work is assisting on setting patient up with further resources including trauma resources, therapy at the ___ Violence Prevention, Therapy for Dissociation, Support Groups and possibly psychiatry Differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms initially included non-convulsive status or complex partial seizures with postictal state, limbic encephalitis, psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. However, given the patient's normal cvEEG without evidence of epileptiform discharges and her unremarkable toxic, metabolic, infectious, and structural findings on our thorough work-up, it appears that a provoked or unprovoked seizure is unlikely in this patient. Moreover, given the patient's rapid improvement the next day, limbic encephalitis is unlikely. It is likely that the patient's recent social and physical stressors are underlying her current presentation.

{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: ___ yo M with a history of AAA and Type A aortic dissection presenting for nausea/vomiting with chest and epigastric pain. ACUTE # Emesis. Patient describes nonbloody, occasionally bilious vomiting in the setting of esophageal \"burning\" and marked leukocytosis. MRI of his aorta showed stable AAA and stable dissection without evidence of any other intra-abdominal processes. Labs showed stable hct at 51, troponin < .01, and lipase WNL. The most likely etiology was thought to be a viral gastroenteritis given headaches, chills, and diarrhea, but given history of improvement with warm baths, this could also represent cannibis emesis syndrome. He was managed with zofran and given maintenance IV fluids on the floor, with improvement in his symptoms and tolerating POs at the time of his discharge. # ___. At presentation, his Cre was 2.6 (from a baseline of 0.7-1.0). This was most likely pre-renal given his recent repeated emesis and poor PO intake. MRI aorta showing widely perfused renal arteries bilaterally. He was given lactated ringers and clears as tolerated. At the time of discharge, his cre was 0.9 and he denied lightheadedness, dizziness, or thirst with stable vitals. # Leukocytosis. He had an elevated WBC of 18 from baseline 9 on presentation with no associated fever. This was thought to represent enteritis, but could also be an inflammatory response from his recent vomiting. Of note, there was no evidence of other infectious etiologies (CXR WNL, no dysuria, UA WNL). # Hypokalemia. His K was 3.0 on admission, likely low in the setting of emesis and poor PO intake. T wave inversions in V4-V6 on EKG are similar to his previous presentations of nausea/vomiting and hypokalemia. Given persistent hypokalemia and hypertension in the setting of known bilateral adrenal nodules, this may also represent Conn's syndrome vs. renal hypoperfusion from his dissection (limited perfusion through his renal artery pseudolumen). His hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, and spironolactone were held during admission, and his potassium was repleted (40 mEq PO, 40 mEq IV) to 4.3 at the time of discharge, with further workup for Conn's syndrome recommended in the outpatient setting. CHRONIC # Aortic dissections. His dissections were stable per ___ MRI, and he denies his classic pain radiating to back during this presentation. His blood pressures remained stable throughout this admission. # HTN. His hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril were held during this admission given his acute kidney injury, and he was transitioned to 50 mg metoprolol tartrate for blood pressure control. At the time of discharge, he was restarted on his home medication with plan to revisit his dosing at his next PCP ___. TRANSITION # Emesis. His current picture was thought to be most likely with viral gastroenteritis, however given his association with marijuana and the absence of obvious intraabdominal pathology on MRI aorta. Consider further evaluation for cannibis emesis syndrome. # Hypokalemia. Persistent hypokalemia in the setting of aggressive potassium repletion with coconut water, hypertension, and adrenal nodules on imaging is concerning for Conn's syndrome. Urinalysis, renin, and aldosterone were unable to be obtained due to patient's strong preference for outpatient workup. If this cannot be performed, transition of diuretics from hydrochlorothiazide to aldactone is recommended. This was unable to be performed as an inpatient due to the patients strong desire to leave the hospital the day after discharge (whether AMA or not).", "summary": "You were admitted for nausea and vomiting. In the hospital, you were given IV fluids. Lab studies showed a worsening of your renal function. We believe your symptoms were likely related to a recent viral illness called gastroenteritis, as well as a low potassium, which you have had in the past. Initial imaging (MRI of your aorta) confirmed that this was unrelated to your known aortic dissections. In addition to continuing your IV fluids along with potassium supplementation, we held your blood pressure medications (lisinopril, hydrochlorothiazide) until discharge due to your decreased renal function. At the time of discharge, your potassium and renal function had returned to normal."}
