He had a stroke in ___, which could be the source of a seizure focus. He also has a high risk for stroke given his mechanical mitral valve, even though he has remained well-controlled on Coumadin. Normal head CT ruled out hemorrhagic stroke at this time, and normal-appearing vessels on CTA helped to rule out large-vessel thrombo-embolic stroke. EEG was performed, and showed no signs of ongoing seizure activity. MRI showed: 1. Slight asymmetric prominence of the left temporal horn without abnormal signal could be within normal limits or suggest early left hippocampal atrophy. 2. No evidence of acute infarction. 3. Chronic medial right precentral gyrus infarction. ___ was started on levetiracetam 750mg PO BID as seizure prophylaxis. While he was admitted, ___ INR was 3.9.

Initially you were treated for meningitis while in the emergency department, but once you came up to us, we noted that your white blood cell count was not elevated, you had no neck stiffness, and your neuro exam was normal, making meningitis unlikely. You did have some discomfort to palpation of your sinuses. We narrowed your antibiotics to an oral one to treat for bacterial sinusitis, and observed you in the hospital to make sure you did not spike another fever. Your headache was thought to be due to sinus headache + migraine, and we trialed various medications including opiods, sumatriptan, and medications that would help your muscles relax. These were not very effective, and you could not really take NSAIDs, hence we asked neurology for their input. Another issue that we noticed was that of your anemia. In the ED, they found blood in your stool, and there were also guaiac positive stools documented during your stay, which could be related to combined use of NSAIDs and apixaban. We sent out some studies which revealed that you had iron deficiency anemia, and tried to set up follow up with gastroenterology so that they could evaluate why you are losing blood in your stools. We started you on a proton pump inhibitor given the blood in your stools; the gastroenterologists will help decide how long you should be on this. We also started you on iron supplementation. As this can be constipating, we gave you some stool softeners to use in case you had trouble with your bowel movements. We reached out to your cardiologist to clarify whether they wanted to keep you on blood thinners- and they did. You looked well enough to go home, hence we discharged you with a course of oral antibiotics. We also gave you steroids per neurology recommendations."}

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: PRIMARY REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION: Patient is a ___ year old female with past medical history of monthly abdominal pain and nausea with menses who presents with persistent nausea and vomiting with epigastric pain during her menstrual period. She also has persistant lower tight substernal pain and has had multiple presentations to the ED for this prior to this admission. She was treated for gastritis related to heavy NSAID use during menstrual cycles and improved with maalox, viscous lidocaine, and PPI. She was discharged home to PCP ___ when tolerating PO intake. . ACUTE CARE: 1. NSAID GASTRITIS: Patient initially felt cramping lower abdominal pain at home for which she took motrin, and the pain then evolved into an epigastric abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting with an episode of coffee ground emesis. Potential etiologies considered include NSAID gastritis, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and PUD. Her marijuana use may have been protective of nausea\/vomiting, though cannabinoid toxicity can cause hyperemesis with abdominal pain. She does not display the typically alleviation of symptoms with hot showers. Cessation of marijuana does not typically cause withdrawal symptoms. Her electrolyte abnormalities of hypokalemia and hyponatremia on admission may suggest volume depletion from N\/V and poor PO intake, and these improved with IVF and treatment of nausea. CT abdomen did not show any evidence of pathology that would explain her abdominal pain. Pregnancy test was negative. Slight bandemia of 1% with normal WBC count may indicate an infection of presumed GI etiology, but she has not reported any diarrhea so this would be less likely. Viral gastroenteritis is always a possibility, though less likely without diarrhea. She was treated initially with antiemetics and then received treatment with PPI, maalox, and viscous lidocaine. He lower substernal pain resolved immediately with the maalox, and her stomach pain improved greatly with the maalox and PPI over 2 days. She was able to tolerate PO intake and went home to ___ with instructions to avoid NSAIDs in the future. . TRANSITIONS IN CARE: 1. MEDICATION CHANGES: 1.

You underwent a left leg angiogram during your admission and angioplasty of one of your arteries in your leg. Despite this attempt at revascularization, this procedure demonstrated severe arterial disease. Post-operatively, we took an X-Ray of your foot which demonstrated osteomyelitis, an infection of the bone. In conjunction with the Podiatry team, we determined that you will likely need a Trans-Metatarsal Amputation. You and your family chose to defer surgery pending a more involved discussion at home. At this time, the best option is for you to return home and first follow up with us in the Vascular Surgery clinic before seeing the Podiatry team."}
{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with stage IV NSCLC admitted for lactic acidosis. . # Lactic acidosis: Anion gap of 15 on admission. During recent admission (___), no lactate was measured although AG ranged from ___ and bicarb ___ during admission with albumin >4. Differential includes type A lactic acidosis (hypoperfusion) from SIRS in setting of pneumonia or cardiogenic shock from ACS versus type B lactic acidosis from metformin\/diabetes or active malignancy. No evidence of liver mets or decreased synthetic function to suggest inability to clear lactate. While in the ICU, the patient's metformin was held, venous lactate levels and anion gap were followed. He received maintenence fluids. His lactate was downtrending on transfer to the floor. . # Chest pain\/CAD: Low suspicion for ACS given ECG in ED unchanged without ST-T wave abnormalities. CTA negative for PE and patient was CP free throughout his stay in the ICU. His home meds including ASA, statin, lisinopril, and nadolol were continued. . # Leukocytosis: likely secondary to dexamethasone, WBC and fever curve were stable in ICU. . # Lung CA: Per primary oncologist, Dr ___ was continued. The patient received whole brain XRT while in the ICU, with plans to receive another dose the day after ICU discharge . # Ground glass opacities: Patchy ground glass opacities on CT present in ___. Given heteregenous nature, unlikely to be edema. Less likely to be blood, and low likelihood given clinical presentation for bacterial infection. Given recent dexamethasone therapy, concern for PCP given lack of prophylaxis, although ground glass present prior to initiation of dexamethasone makes this less likely. Pt was started on PCP prophylaxis with ___ . # COPD: Advair, tiotropium, and albuterol were continued. . # HTN: Home regimen of amlodipine and lisinopril was continued. . # Diabetes, type 2: Metformin given lactic acidosis and contrast load, pt was covered with ISS with accuchecks. . # Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued, ezetimibe held given lack of data regarding benefit. . # GERD: PPI Continued","summary":"You were admitted because you were found in clinic to be short of breath with chest pain. A heart related cause was ruled out with testing, however another test showed that you had too much lactic acid. This is usually a seroius sign that your body is not getting enough oxygen. Thus, you spent a night in the ICU. It was discovered also that your blood sugar was far too high. Accordingly, your lactic acid may be the result of uncontrolled diabetes and the pill (metformin) you were using to treat it. We followed your labs and you gradually improved. At the same time, you were able to receive radiation therapy. You were discharged with a new diabetes treatment regimen: NEW Lantus 20 units in the morning NEW Glypizide 5 mg twice a day NEW Bactrim - to prevent a lung infection when on steroids STOP Metformin HOLD Ezetimibe, Fenofibrate - discuss instead starting a statin (such as simvastatin) with your primary care doctor. Your sugars are elevated due to your steroids - once your steroids are decreased this diabetes regimen will need to be adjusted."}
