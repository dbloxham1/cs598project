His EKG showed new lateral T wave inversions. A TEE & TTE were obtained which effectively ruled out valvular endocarditis; there were also no wall motion abnormalities. Given his viral-like syndrome, several viral serologies were sent, including EBV, CMV, HIV, & a hepatitis panel. The results were negative for acute infection. His admission blood cultures were negative. # Intracranial Hemorrhage: Several days into his hospitalization, it was noted that Mr. ___ speech was altered. A head CT was obtained which showed a intracranial hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia. This bleed was thought to be secondary to HTN in the setting of anticoagulation on coumadin. Several subsequent imaging studies were obtained to follow the bleed. An MRI brain showed some edema surrounding the ICH which was concerning for a possible mass\/metastatic lesion (although the location is atypical for a metastatic lesion). As such, Mr. ___ had a CT chest, abdomen, & pelvis which did not reveal an lesions concerning for a primary malignancy. It was subsequently thought that the edema represented a subacute bleed that rebled during hospitalization.

Several days thereafter, he developed swelling and erythema of mid & forefoot, without discrete effusion. Plain films were obtained which were unrevealing. Given that the patient was told in the past that he had gout, he was treated for a presumed flare with two doses of colchicine. His symptoms greatly improved & he had minimal pain at the time of discharge. CHRONIC DIAGNOSES # Mitral Regurgitation s\/p repair: TTE & TEE showed a well-seated mitral valve. Given that the patient no longer requires coumadin for his mitral valve repair, this medication was discontinued in the setting of his ICH (as above). # HTN: After the patient's ICH, his goal blood pressure was 110-160 systolic. His blood pressure remained in this range on his current regimen of enalapril & BP in good controll; continued home carvedilol and enalapril & carvedilol.

His initial exam of vertical nystagmus, left hypertropia, left INO was concerning for an acute vascular event affecting the medial midbrain. An MRI brain was negative for acute stroke and he was therefore felt to have an MRI-negative stroke. His exam improved throughout his inpatient course and was notable only for vertical diplopia with right lateral gaze upon discharge. An echocardiogram was performed and demonstrated an ASD versus PFO. He was at increased risk for DVT given recent plane travel; however, a hypercoagulability panel should be considered for further workup once he has returned home. An MRV and bilateral lower extremity ultrasound were performed and demonstrated no evidence of DVT in the legs or pelvis. Stroke risk factors include hyperlipidemia (LDL 136), though HbA1c (4.5%) and TSH (1.3) were within normal limits. He remained on telemetry during his hospital stay and there was no evidence of atrial fibrillation. Given hyperlipidemia, he was started on atorvastatin 40mg.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: The patient is an ___ year old man with history of CHF and CAD (NSTEMI in ___ who presented with a CHF exacerbation which was complicated by a moderate pericardial effusion unable to be tapped due to supratherapeutic INR. By the time his INR was less than two, the pericardial effusion had decreased and did not need to be tapped. The patient developed afib with RVR that was difficult to control due to hypotension and he was pharmocologically cardioverted and discharged on amiodarone in sinus rhythm to prevent atrial fibrillation which was the likely cause of the CHF exacerbation. # CHF, acute on chronic, systolic and diastolic, EF 50% Clinical picture consistent with CHF exacerbation with progressive dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, weight gain and JVD and ___ edema on exam. Initially the cause of the exacerbtaion was unclear; however when the patient was in afib, his rate was very high in the 150s, he was hypotensive and felt very ill, so the exacerbation was likely secondary to paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Diuresis was initially delayed secondary to a moderate pericardial effusion that was unable to be tapped due to INR of 4.5 on admission. When his INR was <2, his effusion had decreased in size and did not need to be tapped. He was then diuresed with IV lasix and placed on a drip on day prior to discharge. He was much less short of breath on discharge and eager to go home. He was discharged on 40mg lasix daily as he was still slightly volume overloaded. His ACE and beta blockers were continued but he was discharged on lower doses of each as his blood pressures were low. # Afib with RVR He was in sinus rhythm until ___, but went into atrial fibrillation on that day. His rates were in the 150s and were difficult to control. He did not respond to diltiazem even at a 15mg\/hr IV drip. He was hypotensive with SBP in low ___ to mid ___. He did respond to IV lopressor but only moderatley and given the CHF exacerbation that was the reason for admission, it decided that the patient would benefit from rhythm control with amiodarone. He was PO loaded and converted to NSR with rates inthe ___ on ___. He did not receive any IV amiodarone. His thyroid function was baseline. He was anticoagulated with heparin until INR was therapeutic. Metoprolol was continued and he was discharged on a dose lower than his home dose on admission. # Prerenal azotemia His creatinine was elevated at 1.7 on admission. It improved through the course of the stay, with a nadir of 1.1. It then increaed again after the patient was in afib with RVR and also post diuresis. Creatine increase likely secondary to poor forward flow from CHF vs afib. # Cough He had a cough and the chest xray from the OSH was read as a RLL PNA, but CXR here without evidence of PNA and patient remained afebrile without leukocystosis. Cough may have been secondary to CHF and\/or URI. He was treated symptomatically with cough syrup in addition to diuresis for CHF. # Supratherapeutic INR Perhaps secondary to hepatic congestion from CHF and\/or dietary changes. We also started him on amiodarone. He was discharged on 2mg coumadin daily (he was on 5mg daily on admission. He will likely need frequent monitoring until INR stable. # HLD: continued statin as above.

Continued tamsulosin.","summary":"You were admitted because you were very short of breath. This is called congestive heart failure. You were short of breath because your heart was not able to effectively circulate blood and it backed up into your lungs and legs. This is why you gained so much weight and your legs were swollen. You had some extra fluid around your heart and it couldn't be drained right away because your INR was too high. By the time that the INR had drifted down, the fluid around your heart was much less and you did not need it drained. You went into an abnormal rhythm called atrial fibrillation. Your heart rate was very fast and your blood pressure was low. You have been in this rhythm before and we suspect that going in and out of this rhythm is what caused you to go into heart failure and cause the fluid to build up. We started a medicine called amiodarone which will help your heart stay in a normal rhythm. You felt much better when your heart was in a normal rhythm.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: The patient is a ___ year old right handed man with a history of hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis who presented with dysarthria and difficulty getting out of bed (due to weakness vs. imbalance). On initial neurology examination, he was found to be dysarthric with somewhat cautious gait, but had no facial asymmetry and full strength. While in the ___ ED (and after initial neurology evaluation) several hours later, the patient had been sitting upright and subsequently developed expressive aphasia especially with difficulty initiating sentences, increased difficulty with naming, and increased somnolence. He also was found to have flattening of his right NLF and right arm\/leg UMN pattern of weakness. Given concern for flow dependent stenosis, the patient was laid flat and taken urgently to CTA head\/CTP. The CTA head\/CTP showed moderately prominent atherosclerotic narrowing (approximately 70%) involving the origin of the left ICA and slightly less on the right sided ICA origin, very poor flow within the vertebral arteries which appear thread-like and in a segmental fashion particularly noticeable on the left side, and the basilar artery was extremely attenuated. The patient was started on a heparin gtt and admitted to the Neurology Step-Down Unit. MRI head showed acute ischemia in the left paramidline pons and possibly a punctate focus of ischemia in the left parietal cortex (however this latter finding was difficult to find). There was relatively poor visualization of the bilateral distal vertebral and basilar artery. His stroke was thought to be atherothrombotic in the setting of basilar artery stenosis. He was continued on heparin gtt for bridge to Coumadin 5 mg daily. At the time of discharge, his PTT was 51.9 and his INR was 1.3. His goal PTT is 50-70, and can be checked daily as long as it remains therapeutic. His heparin gtt should be adjusted if outside this goal range, and then PTTs should be checked q6 hours until therpeutic x3. His goal INR is ___ and should be checked daily until therapeutic. The patient's Zesteretic was held in the setting of acute stroke to allow for autoregulation. This continued to be held during the hospitalization given his flow dependent stenosis of the basilar artery. The Zeteretic can be considered to be added back in ___ weeks. Cardiac telemetry and multiple EKGs showed sinus rhythm with frequent APBs. TTE showed LVEF 65-70% with mild aortic stenosis, and no intracardiac source of embolism identified. FLP showed Chol 178, ___ 167, LDL 121, HDL 24, and he was started on Simvastatin 20 mg daily. HgA1c was 5.8%. His CEs on admission showed CK 715, CKMB 42, and TropT 0.09. His CK was 535 at the time of discharge, but his TropT increased to 0.19. Cardiology was consulted, and thought this was most likely demand ischemia in the setting of stroke, hypertension, and aortic stenosis. He was started on ASA 81 mg daily and Metoprolol 12.5 mg bid. He was instructed to follow up with his PCP once discharged from rehab for an exercise treadmill test with imaging to further evaluate for CAD. The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis, and was recently prescribed Plaquenil 200 mg bid (which he never started taking as this was on mail order). This medication was not restarted while hospitalized, given concern for interactions with his medications.

She additionally presents wtih 5 days of non-bloody watery diarrhea in the absence of fevers or other systemic symptoms. # Hypoglycemia - Thought to be due to continued use of insulin and glyburide in the setting of decreased PO intake (see below). When she was admitted to the Emergency Department she was treated with multiple doses of D50 as well as octreotide and D10W. Her glyburide and insulin wer discontinued. Her sugars remained labile throughout the night of her presentation between ___. When she came to the floor, her sugars were stable and >70 with one isolated ___ of 70. She continued to receive octreotide and D10 on the floor but requried no treatment with D50 or glucagon; she was monitored with Q2H finger-sticks. On the night of her transfer to the floor she was treated with 10 units of lantus. On the day prior to dischare, D10 was stopped and the patient was tolerating some PO intake. On the morning of discharge, an AM glucose was 70 but increased to the ___ with cranberry juice and crackers; her ___ dose of Lantus was reduced to 7. ___ consulted throughout her stay and assisted in her management. She is scheduled to follow-up at ___ for further management of her diabetes care. . The reason for medication use is likely due to misunderstanding of risks of hypoglycemia versus hyperglycemia as well as difficult social situation resulting in confusion as patient describes. She denied SI or deliberate drug overdose and suspicion for this remains low. . # Diarrhea\/GI upset - Given lack of systemic signs such as fever, leukocytosis, or bloody diarrhea, this likely represented viral gastroenteritis or toxin-based gastro (staph aureus, b-cereus). Her abdominal discomfort and diarrhea was aggravated by colonoscopy prep that patient took. Invasive bacterial infection such as EHEC, salmonella, shigella, listeria were unlikely as was C-dif. At the time of discharge her diarrhea and abdominal discomfort were improved. . # CHF - Given last echo with preserved EF and the absence of symptoms (shortness of breath, worsened edema), the patient appeared to be compensated. However, due to the large amounts of fluid she received, her volume status was monitored and a CXR was ordered. The CXR was unchanged from previous. . #Anemia - long standing history of anemia thought to be iron defficiency; hct currently low normal and around baseline (which fluctuates between ___.

The Lovenox is the medication that rapidly anticoagulates you, which is used initially while the Coumadin takes time to anticoagulate. The Coumadin will be the anticoagulant that you will continue to take for the upcoming months. The chest and back pain that you have been experiencing may or may not be related to the pulmonary embolism. Your cardiac biomarkers and EKG were negative for any acute cardiac process, such as a heart attack. You can mannage your pain with Tylenol or Motrin as needed once you leave the hospital. On CT scan, small pulmonary nodules were noted in your lungs bilaterally. It is difficult to remark on their clinical significance at this time.

After administration of 100 mg lidocaine and 5 mg IV metoprolol, the patient converted to NSR after 10 min. She remained hemodynamically stable. It was unclear initially if cause of monomorphic VT was due to ischemia (in which one would expect more polymorphic VT in that case) or due to an underlying arrhythmia. The patient underwent an echo ___ which showed no signs of ischemia and then she subsequently underwent VT ablation which was not completely successful, as she still had intermittent VT with stimulation afterwards. She was started on propafenone and metoprolol XL. The propafenone was later discontinued. Her initial dose of metoprolol was decreased due to soft pressures, which the patient tolerated well. In trying to determine other causes of VT, the patient underwent cardiac MRI and MRA chest w\/contrast. The preliminary read on the reports (final results were not available at time of discharge) did not indicate any abnormalities or other evidence of late gadolinium enhancement. Her Lyme serologies were negative. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and asymptomatic during hospitalization.

She was started on a heparin drip, made NPO ,and was given pain medication to help with what was presumed to be some pain although her baseline neurological status made this difficult to assess. The neurology service was asked to see the patient and help verify that this was indeed her baseline neurological status, which it was agreed that yes this was after discussing with the care staff at her facility. Per their request a phenytoin level was checked that showed it to be on the high end of normal and so her phenytoin dose was kept constant. the difficult question became how aggressive to treat her vascular issues.

Diagnosis for multiple myeloma was made. . #Multiple Myeloma: Lucency on hip xray prompted tests for total calcium = 10.2, with positive SPEP and UPEP. CT chest showed diffuse bony lesions. HemeOnc was consulted, and made the diagnosis of multiple myeloma after bone marrow biopsy. IgG =6261 (monoclonal IgG lambda) Beta-2 microglobulin = 3.0 Serum Viscosity = 1.9 MRI spine showed compression at level of T3 and involvement of T7 vertebral body.

Post spine surgery, patient required several days of mechanical ventilation post-op, and developed an enlarging R-sided pleural effusion that expanded after extubation. She was started on antibiotics empirically for VAT. Pulmonary was consulted and performed thoracentesis x 2. Transudative on both occasions. Cytology showed plasma cells. Completed 14-day course of aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, flagyl, and vancomycin. After termination of antibiotics remained afebrile. Continued diuresis with goal of -1.5 L per day with good results. There were some blood pressure lability and tachycardia which eventually resovled.
