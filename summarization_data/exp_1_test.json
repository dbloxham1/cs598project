{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: Mr. ___ was admitted to the Neurologic ICU. His blood pressure was kept >140 with norepinephrine and his was kept lying flat to maximize his cerebral perfusion. His exam did improve over the first 24 hours of admission but he did have persistent left sided weaknes, facial weakness and some EOM abnormalities. He did not have any worsening of his exam and BP parameters were broadened to goal >120. This allowed to wean off of pressors. The HOB was slowly increased as tolerated. He was eventually able to sit up without any changes in his exam. He had initially been started on a heparin gtt, but upon further assessment of his risks of GI bleeding and this stopped and he was started on aspirin. The etiology of Mr. ___ stroke is thought to be a result of his dolicoectatic basilar artery. CTA demonstrated a reduction in size of the previously known basilar thrombus\/plaque. Mr. ___ had stopped his aspirin roughly a month before presentation due to GI bleeding which may have increase his stroke risk. MRI was consistent with infarction of the anterior right cerebellum and right basis pontis. Risk factors were assessed, LDL was 101 and he was started on atorvastatin. When the patient no longer required norepinephrine for blood pressure support and his exam was unchanged with changing position, he was transferred to the neurology floor. Prior to transfer the patient became febrile and was found to have pneumonia. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for coverage of HAP. Floor Course: Mr ___ was transferred from the ICU to the floor once he was stabilized. He had a Speech and Swallow evaluation and was cleared for thin liquids and soft, moist solids. His antibiotics were discontinued after three days as he remained afebrile with no evidence of respiratory distress. He was otherwise stable throughout his floor course. We continued him on his midodrine and continued to hold his lisinopril in order to keep his blood pressure slightly elevated to allow for adequate CNS perfusion.

ACTIVE ISSUES: # Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Dyspea and cough on presentation most likely secondary to a CHF exacerbation, although HCAP was considered. Given symptoms while lying flat and prior cardiac history, acute on chronic CHF seemed most consistent. No EKG changes; troponin elevated to 0.11-0.12; CK-MB flat. CXR's on admission and several days later were consistent with volume overload. Acute systemic infection could cause worsening in cardiac function. Last TTE ___ showed EF 60% with normal global function and normal wall thickness. Patient had a TTE on ___ showing mildly decreased EF from his last TTE of 45-50%, mild lateral hypokinesis, and signficant pulmonary hypertension. Pt was seen by Cardiology consult team who felt that, upon review of the TTE, the echo demonstrated minimal wall motion abnormality but marked increase in severity of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension. Patient has extra fluid removed by ultrafiltration at dialysis. Pt's weight after his last session of dialysis in the hospital (on ___ was 63.7kg but still noted to be fluid overloaded. His new dry weight is likely still lower than this (may be 61kg or even lower). Would encourage further dialysis sessions to continue to challenge him with fluid removal. He required no supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge. . # Concern for HCAP: Despite symptoms consistent with CHF, patient also received several days of empiric coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia. He presented with symptoms of productive cough, dyspnea lying flat and with exertion, confusion, and initially, CXR read could not exclude consolidation. Given recent hospitalizations and failed improvement on outpatient Cipro, possible PNA would be HCAP. His CURB-65 score was 2 with points for confusion and age. Patient was initially started on vanc\/aztreonam because of PCN allergy history (on review of past records, patient was treated with cephalexin in ___ for wound infection, so would likely tolerate a cephalosporin). This was modified to vancomycin\/cefepime, then weaned to cefpodoxime\/doxycycline, then finally discontinued after three days of antibiotics, as he was afebrile without a leukocytosis or clear consolidation for the course of his admission. He was also treated with Duonebs and encouraged to use IS. . # Hypertension: Patient with history of hypertension, but not on any antihypertensives for the past several admissions at least. Has elevated systolic and diastolic pressures here, probably somewhat attributable to volume overload. Was started on amlodipine 5 mg PO daily with good response in blood pressure. Dialysis team was able to remove some fluid by ultrafiltration. Cardiology team suggested switching amlodipine to ACEI for afterload reduction, but pt has history of hyperkalemia with lisinopril in the past (though did not seem to be on dialysis at that time). Renal consult team was okay with initiating lisinopril, but decision was deferred to outpatient Cardiologist. . # Hypophosphatemia: Phos has been low during this admission. His sevelamer carbonate 3200 mg TID and sevelamer carbonate 1600 mg PO PRN snacks were held during the admission and upon discharge. If restarted as an outpatient, would consider decreasing dose to 1600 mg TID. . # Acute Delirium - Pt has had intermittent confusion during this hospitalization due to unclear cause. He was on Mirtazipine as an outpatient which was discontinued upon admission, in case this was contributing to his admission. Could be due to his symptoms of fluid overload, and pt has not been sleeping well since admission, despite trazodone. His B12 and TSH are normal. It is likely that getting him back to a familiar (environment) where he can sleep normally will help him greatly. . CHRONIC ISSUES: # ESRD: ESRD on HD (___).

He was continued on his amiodarone throughout his stay. . # Macrocytic Anemia: Baseline ___, currently stable. Likely secondary to underlying ESRD. B12 and folate wnl. . # CAD: Pt continued on statin as below. Cardiology consult team recommended initiation of aspirin 81mg daily. Pt is anticoagulated on coumadin, and so deferred decision to initiate aspirin to outpatient cardiologist. . # HLD: Pt was continued on home simvastatin 10 mg daily . # s\/p Spinal Surgery: Pt free of pain during hospital course. Continued acetaminophen 1 g TID standing. . # Hypothyroidism: Last TSH in our system was in ___ and was 2.6. Continued Levothyroxine 25 mcg daily. . # Depression: Continued Celexa 40 mg Daily. Held Mirtazapine 15 mg QHS as this may have contributed to confusion on admission. . # GERD: Continued pantoprazole 40 mg daily . . TRANSITIONAL: # Consider initiation of aspirin therapy for CAD (though pt is anticoagulated on coumadin) for optimization of medical management. # Would discontinue mirtazapine, as likely contributed to presenting confusion. # Pt's weight after his last session of dialysis in the hospital (on ___ was 63.7kg but still noted to be fluid overloaded. His new dry weight is likely still lower than this (around 61kg or even lower per our inpatient renal team).

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: ___ with history asthma, celiac disease, CKD (baseline Cr unknown), CAD s\/p CABG, h\/o ischemic colitis presents with episodes of paranoia, found to be hypothyroid and with widely varying blood glucose measurements despite insulin pump use. # DM: Originally diagnosed in ___, has been on insulin pump for years with good success. She appears well-educated with regard to pump use and diet, but for the last several weeks has had a difficult time controlling her sugars. At the OSH her glucose was noted to be between 20 and 500s. She was transferred here for management of hyperglycemia. She refused to relinquish her pump on admission due to her long history of self-management, and reports that the pump needs to be resited on the day of admission. The ___ diabetes management team saw the patient and adjusted her pump settings to provide more consistent control. Her HbA1c was noted to be elevated to 10.9%. Nursing staff reported that although the patient was very comfortable and capable of programming the pump, she sometimes needed to be spurred to do so. Therefore it was recommended that during her acute psychiatric care she be transferred to a sliding scale to allow more careful regulation of her glucose. ___ provided a sliding scale that was initiated the evening of ___. This was adjusted over the next two days to provide good control despite dietary inconsistency. She had scheduled ___ with ___ providers for late ___. # Hypothyroidism: The patient has a history of hypothyroidism maintained on levothyroxine. She claims that she has been taking her medication \"pretty religiously\", although she cannot guarantee full adherence. TSH at OSH 97, prior trend unknown at this time. The patient endorses fatigue, but no hair or skin changes. She has chronic rash attributed to dermatitis herpetiformis, she reports unchanged. She has had weight loss rather than weight gain. She denies feeling cold. Repeat TSH > 100, but T4 1.0 (normal) and T3 slightly low at 64. This was most consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism, currently under treatment with levothyroxine. No changes were made to her home regimen. # Behavioral changes: Patient reported increased anxiety and paranoid thinking. She also reported fatigue and depressed mood. She stated that people can redirect her paranoid thinking, but she had difficulty convincing herself that they are right. There was initial concern for hypotyroidism or hypoglycemia contributing to these feelings. However, her B12 and folate were normal, her thyroid function normal (as noted above), and her RPR negative. Her mood and thought process changes persisted despite normal glucose levels. Our Psychiatry team evaluated the patient and determined that she was suffering from depression, possibly with psychotic features, and anxiety. They recommended inpatient psychiatry admission. Her home Valium was reduced in dose to avoid sedation, but per Psychiatry Risperdal QHS was started. The night prior to discharge she left her room and was found in the lobby, confused but directable. Per report she may have been holding an insulin syringe, although this could not be substantiated. She denied any knowledge of this, although she stated she was confused and could not be sure of her actions. Tox screen negative. No further events. # GERD: Patient complains of epigastric discomfort, particularly on an empty stomach, relieved by eating. This is worst in the evenings. EKGs no changes. Pain is relieved with Tums and PPI. PPI dosing increased to twice daily. # CAD s\/p CABG: continued ASA, Plavix, bisoprolol (home medication) # BP regulation: holding midodrine, Florinef, Cozaar, HCTZ pending requirement.

This should be considered in the outpatient setting as Cr downtrends. ___ will follow up with rheumatology as an outpatient. #Afib: During his hospital course, he had 1 episode when he alarmed on telemetry for tachycardia. EKG at that time showed afib. He converted to sinus rhythm spontaneously. However, given CHADS2 of 3, he was started on anticoagulation with apixaban. Coumadin was not chosen given very poor compliance history. Prior to anticoagulation, ___ had CT head followed by MRI brain to rule out brain mets given history of metastatic prostate CA. These were negative for mets. He was continued on apixaban and Metoprolol as above throughout hospital course. ___ on CKD: Cr 2 on admission from baseline 1.6-1.8. This was felt to be cardiorenal given significant volume overload, and initially downtrended with diuresis. However, Cr then rose after continued diuresis; this was felt to be more pre-renal with aggressive diuresis. By the time of discharge, creatinine was stable at 2.5 and should be followed up in the outpatient setting. #Hypothyroidism: ___ on home ___ thyroid. Total T4 and FT4 wnl this admission, however, TSH significantly elevated at 16. With his fatigue and constipation, it is possible that he was symptomatic despite normal FT4. However, no dose adjustments were made in his thyroid regimen given acute HF exacerbation. Anti-TPO was checked due to ___ 1:640 per rheumatology recommendation; this was negative. If pt continues to show evidence of hypothyroidism, would consider adjusting dose of armour thyroid or changing to levothyroxine. #Normocytic anemia: Fe studies consistent with ACD. His H\/H remained stable through hospital course and he did not require transfusion. #Hypervolemic hyponatremia: ___ was noted to have hyponatrema to low 120s, which was felt to be due to hypervolemic hyponatremia in setting of HF exacerbation given volume overload on exam.

ACEI was held as above due to ___ initially but then started on lisinopril 5 mg prior to discharge. #HLD: given LDL-C >190, ___ warrants high intensity statin. He was started on atorvastatin 80 mg qHS this admission. #H\/o prostate cancer: ___ lost to follow up despite history of metastatic prostate CA per son. PSA elevated to 40 this admission from prior 33 in ___. Discussed prostate ___ status with outpatient urologist. Per urologist, pt does warrant MRI prostate and bone scan for follow up given history of metastatic disease. These were ordered but cancelled as should be accomplished in the outpatient setting. ___ and family agreed to follow up as an outpatient. Of note, pt had CT head and MRI brain prior to anticoagulation; this showed no metastatic involvement. #Vitamin supplementation: ___ takes a significant number of supplements (approx. 30 meds). These were discussed in detail with pharmacy and there is a concern for CYP interactions as well as increased bleeding risk. Given this, ___ was encouraged to avoid all non-FDA approved, non-prescriptions medications. ___ was willing to comply with all by chromium and bromide, which he states he takes for prostate CA. Vitamin D was checked due to concern for excessive vitamin D supplementation; this was mildly elevated at 68. #Leukocytosis: ___ afebrile, not meeting any SIRS criteria. CXR was unable to exclude PNA but no cough, fevers, chills to suggest PNA clinically. UA, Ucx, Blood Cx negative. Leukocytosis downtrended over hospital course. #H\/o DM: pt reports h\/o DM, not on home meds.

He may warrant cardiac MR to rule out infiltrative pathology causing his HF but this was not done given ___ and concern for NSF during this hospitalization. -___ takes a significant number of supplements (approx. 30 meds). These were discussed in detail with pharmacy and there is a concern for CYP interactions as well as increased bleeding risk. Given this, ___ was encouraged to avoid all non-FDA approved, non-prescriptions medications. ___ was willing to comply with all by chromium and bromide, which he states he takes for prostate CA. -___ is not hepatitis B immune. Please consider vaccination in outpatient setting. -Please consider cardiac catheterization to rule out CAD as an etiology of his HF. This was not pursued during inpatient course due to ___ and concern for contrast load. CMR should be considered as etiology of his HFrEF remains unclear. -___ requires MRI prostate and bone scan for follow up of prostate CA (history of partially treated metastatic disease and significant noncompliance with medical therapy). -___ had significantly elevated TSH at 16 with normal FT4. Thyroid medication could be adjusted to normalize TSH if pt is symptomatic. This was considered given volume overload, constipation, and fatigue but was ultimately deferred given HF exacerbation. If pt continues to show evidence of hypothyroidism, would consider adjusting dose of armour thyroid or changing to levothyroxine. -Pt's ACEI and BB may be uptitrated as necessary -Contact ___ (son-in-law) ___ -Full code -Discharge weight: 61.4 kg","summary":"You were seen at ___ due to shortness of breath, difficulty lying flat, and fatigue. You were found to have heart failure, in which your heart does not pump blood forward normally. This causes fluid to back up into your lungs and your legs. We gave you a medication to remove this fluid, and you improved. This is called Lasix (or furosemide) and you should continue this at home. The cause of your heart failure is unclear at this time. It may be due to high blood pressure, fast heart rates, blockages in your arteries, or rheumatologic disease. You may need a cardiac catheterization to look at the arteries in your heart and make sure there are no blockages. You may also need an MRI of your heart to look for other causes of heart failure. These were not done in the hospital due to your kidneys; both catheterization and MRI can injure your kidneys, so we are giving them time to recover. In addition, you were noted to have an abnormal fast heart rate called atrial fibrillation (or a-fib). This resolved on its own. However, having atrial fibrillation can increase your risk of stroke. For this reason, we put you on a blood thinner called apixaban (or Eliquis). In addition, we spoke with your urologist about your prostate cancer. He plans to do an MRI and a bone scan to follow up your treatment progress."}

ACUTE CARE: 1. NSAID GASTRITIS: Patient initially felt cramping lower abdominal pain at home for which she took motrin, and the pain then evolved into an epigastric abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting with an episode of coffee ground emesis. Potential etiologies considered include NSAID gastritis, dysmenorrhea, endometriosis, and PUD. Her marijuana use may have been protective of nausea\/vomiting, though cannabinoid toxicity can cause hyperemesis with abdominal pain. She does not display the typically alleviation of symptoms with hot showers. Cessation of marijuana does not typically cause withdrawal symptoms. Her electrolyte abnormalities of hypokalemia and hyponatremia on admission may suggest volume depletion from N\/V and poor PO intake, and these improved with IVF and treatment of nausea. CT abdomen did not show any evidence of pathology that would explain her abdominal pain. Pregnancy test was negative. Slight bandemia of 1% with normal WBC count may indicate an infection of presumed GI etiology, but she has not reported any diarrhea so this would be less likely. Viral gastroenteritis is always a possibility, though less likely without diarrhea. She was treated initially with antiemetics and then received treatment with PPI, maalox, and viscous lidocaine.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ was a ___ year-old man with alcoholic and hepatitis C cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver transplant ___ and ESRD on HD who presented with fever and altered mental status thought to have been due to bacteremia and interferon related encephalopathy. . # Fever - Patient was admitted with report of high fever at rehab. Hospital evaluation revealed his fever may have been a drug effect of interferon. Alternatively, his blood culture grew coagulase negative staph in one of four bottles. The remained of his complete infectious work up including UA, UCx, C.Diff PCR, stool cultures, HD catheter tip culture, LP, viral cultures, imaging studies and echocardiogram were negative. Considering his immunosuppressed status and ill appearance, he was continued on vancomycin IV dosed at hemodialysis. Given his the improvement in his fever curve after starting broad spectrum antibiotics, a decision was made to recommend a course of antibiotics for a possible endovascular infection with four weeks of IV Vancomycin (goal trough around 15 acceptable) - recommended duration ___ - ___. . # Encephalopathy - Patient presented with impairments of complex attention and memory storage and had marked cognitive slowing, consistent with encephalopathy or delirium. The etiology was not clear, but possible contributors included metabolic (hepatic and renal dysfunction), infectious from bacteremia with concern for endovascular infection, and drug effect from interferon therapy. He underwent infectious and neurologic. No cerebral infectious focus was identified on MRI, and other than bacteremia, the infectious evaluation was unrevealing. On neurologic evaluation, EEG result was consistent with a toxic\/metabolic type encephalopathy. Interferon was considered the likely culprit in the patients acute encephalopathic state. Mr. ___ was continued on hemodialysis with gradual ongoing improvement noted in his mental status and awareness. This improvement was furthered with physical and occupational therapy. On the day of discharge, he was oriented to himself and hospital and could register the hospital name and year with ___ to the end of the medical interview. . The following admission medications were not continued while admitted and will not be continued at discharge. . 1. Citalopram 30 mg daily was held on admission for concern that it may be contributing to his sedation. This may be resumed following discharge if he shows clinical evidence of depression. 2. Mirtazapine 7.5 mg HS was held on admission for concern that it may be contributing to his sedation. This may be resumed following discharge if he shows clinical evidence of depression. 3. Methylphenidate 5 mg daily was held on admission for concern that it may be contributing to tachycardia. On the day of discharge, he was no longer tachycardic. This may be resumed if he continues to be free of tachycardia and there is concern for hypoactivity and sedation. 4. Megesrol 400 mg BID was held. This medication may be resumed if there is continued concern for poor apetite. 5. Renvela 800 mg Tablet TID was held on admission because his calcium phosphorous product was normal. This may be resumed if his calcium phosphorous product is rises to greater that 40. 6. Infergen 9mcg daily was held on admission. It was suspected that this medication may have precipitated his encephalopathy. The consideration of whether and when to resume hepatitis C treatment will be determined by his outpatient hepatology team. . # Orthotopic liver transplant with recurrent hep C - He has a high viral load two weeks prior to admission and had been stated on Infergen by his outpatient hepatologist. Infergen was discontinued on admission for concern that it was contributing to hypoactivity. Surviellence of his liver funtion tests demonstrated gradual improvement following admission. HCV viral load was repeated following admission with a viral load ___ down from ___. On the day of discharge, his transaminases remained elevated AST>ALT without increase in cholestasis with a total bilirubin of 1.2. . It was recommended that his liver function tests (including ALT, AST, LD, Alk Phos, and T. Bili) be checked three times weekly and the results be faxed to the liver transplant clinic. .

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: # Mediastinal mass discovered with pericardial effusion: Mediastinal mass was biopsied via a CT-guided biopsy. Additionally, cytology was sent on pleural fluid, drawn by thoracentesis. Thoracic surgery service followed from early in the admission to contemplate surgical options, but given that the mass appeared to wrap around the great vessels, surgery deferred to oncology and radiation oncology for the initial treatment planning with the hopes that they would be able to devise a treatment plan to shrink the mass before resection. Preliminary biopsy results had results consistent with colon cancer. This was puzzling, given the clinical history, and given that a follow-up CT scan of abdomen and pelvis showed no liver metastases or abdominal lymphadenopathy. Cytgenetics did not clarify the diagnosis since the pattern does not show characteristics features of either colon or germ cell tumor. Nonetheless, a follow-up colonoscopy was recommended. In terms of the pericardial effusion, treaters have assumed that this was the direct result of the mass. Repeat ECHO prior to discharge showed resolution of the pericardial effusion. The patient was instructed to followup with oncologist, Dr. ___, as an outpatient. . # Tachycardia. Tachycardia eased somewhat with pericardial drainage but nonetheless, ongoing atrial fibrillation with recurring RVR required significant doses of metoprolol to keep in the high ___ 100s. Additionally, it appeared that for a time Mr ___ was effectively dehydrated because of the extensive extravasation associated with his full-torso rash; IV hydration did help to reduce heart rate during this time. Atrial fibrillation was not helpful, but during this period of dehydration was likely not the major factor. Boluses of fluid were given cautiously given his 25% EF. . # Rash: Mr ___ developed a significant morbilliform rash which was consistent in appearance and clinical course with a drug rash, likely in response to lasix. Lasix was added to his drug allergies. Dermatology was consulted and as the rash expanded, recommended a five day course of prednisone 60 mg daily, which was given. There was no mucosal involvement and the rash did begin to fade in its initial areas of appearance (back) by ___, at which point there was clearly the beginning of resolution of the original sites even as the newer areas of involvement (lower parts of upper and lower extremities) became more erythematous and confluent. A skin biopsy was also consistent with drug rash. Symptomatic treatment including antihistamines and topical creams were also given. At discharge, the rash was nearly resolved. . # History of PE: Originally the team held coumadin during the initial time in which the pericardial drain remained in place. The team restarted anticoagulation with a heparin drip to bridge back to coumadin. At discharge his coumadin dose was 2.5 mg daily and he was discharge on a lovenox bridge. . # CAD: s\/p ant MI ___ ago. Restarted aspirin (after being held by past clinicians because of past stroke), as we judged the benefit of aspirin for CAD to outweigh the risk. We continued beta-blocker and statin. . # Seizure: Neurontin was continued. . # Asthma: Nebs prn . # Hypercholesterolemia: Statin was continued. . # BPH: foley in earlier part of admission; flomax . # FEN: cardiac diet, replete lytes prn # PPx: initially pneumoboots, then heparin to coumadin bridge # Code: FULL # Dispo: CCU # Contact: wife .","summary":"You had fluid build-up in your lungs and around your heart, which was drained.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr ___ is a ___ with complex history inlcuding SLE, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, epilepsy, ESRD on peritoneal dialysis, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and PE\/DVT, who presented to ED with oropharyngeal parasthesias and numbness. . ACUTE ISSUES #) Parasthesias\/numbness: Patient with new-onset perioral parasthesias and numbness with numbness also reported in oropharynx. Reports difficulty swallowing given numbness, but no odynaphagia, episodes of choking, respiratory distress. Started new medications three days ago including azithromycin and fluticasone, has been using albuterol. Also reports parasthesias\/numbness in hands and feet occasionally, but this is reported as subacute\/chronic, and per patient, does not seem related to current symptoms. Neuro evaluated patient, thought most likely to be associated with meds, not concerned for primary neurologic process initially. A wide differential was considered included hypocalcemia vs. medication related vs. acute sinusitis vs. anxiety vs. seizure. Calcium was found to be 0.97 (ionized) on admission, which is low, but had negative Chvostek's sign and symptoms have persisted despite calcium supplementation (given 4g overnight). Repeat calcium the next morning was 1.04 (ionized) which remained low, and patient continued without other signs\/symptoms of hypocalcemia. Renal did not think his calcium was contributory given previous low calciums without symptoms. In terms of medications, Neurology thought symptoms were most consistent with medication reaction and was largely unconcerned for primary neurologic process. They did recommend an MRI of the brainstem on day of discharge to ensure no local process was occurring, but given lack of other cranial nerve findings on exam (and preserved functions of the specific cranial nerves that would be affected given the current symptoms, mainly V, VII, XII), this was not pursued as an inpatient and instead deferred to outpatient testing after consultation with PCP. Given patient's URI symptoms for past month and description of head pressure, ear popping\/congestion, symptoms possibly referred acute sinusitis discomfort, though this is more commonly manifested as lower job pressure\/pain rather than numbness. Patient appears very comfortable and unlikely to be experiencing anxiety significant enough to contribute to symptoms. Finally, patient does have history of epilepsy with seizures in the form of strange sensations, especially in his legs. He does sometimes get numbness\/parasthesias in his hands\/feet prior to seizure. Not thought to be seizure given patient's symptoms have been occurring for so many days. Carbamazepine levels were therapeutic at time of admission. The new medications (azithromycin, fluticasone) were held. The patient was observed eating multiple meals without distress. He was discharge home with instructions to discuss pursuing MRI with his PCP. He was also educated about concerning signs that would require return to the hospital mainly worsening dysphagia, odynaphagia, respiratory distress, difficulty clearing secretions, or any other symptom that concerned him. . CHRONIC ISSUES #) Hypertension: Patient with difficult-to-control hypertension, on multiple medications at home including aliskiren, amlodipine, clonidine, labetalol, lisinopril, losartan. Patient gets headaches\/migraines in setting of elevated pressures. Missed some doses of meds prior to admission. Pressure elevated to 155 systolic on admission, but improved during hospitalization to 120s-130s systolic. . #) ESRD on peritoneal dialysis: Patient using PD at home, with catheter in place. No signs of infection or peritonitis. Patient reports increased dialysis times compared to what's directed. Phosphate and creatinine above baseline. Renal evaluated patient and recommended increasing PD times at home as well as a regular bowel regimen (ideally ___ BM\/day) to ensure excretion of phosphorus. . #) h\/O DVT\/PE: History of thrombosis in setting of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome. On warfarin at home, followed at ___. Patient missed the dose of warfarin on ___ while in the ER. An increased dose of 7.5mg was given on ___, and then patient was restarted on normal warfarin schedule. He has home INR equipment and was instructed to check his INR on ___ and call HCA Anticoagulation with the results on ___. . #) Epilepsy: Patient with history of epilepsy, on carbemazepine at home. Levels checked in ER, appropriate. Patient reports strange sensations with seizures, but does not think presenting complaint is consistent. He was continued on his home-dose carbemazepine. . TRANSITIONAL ISSUES #Per Neurology, patient should consider MRI of brainstem (thin slices) to evaluate cranial nerves given continued parasthesias. This was not pursued as an inpatient. Patient asked to discuss with PCP. #Patient's peritoneal dialysis routine was adjusted. Patient should follow-up with Nephrology. #Patient's INR was subtherapeutic during stay because of missed warfarin dose in ER. The patient was given an extra dose and then restarted on his usual regimen. He will check his INR at home. #Patient was asked to make an appointment with his outpatient nephrologist within ___ days to review his updated peritoneal dialysis regimen.","summary":"You were admitted with numbness and tingling around your mouth and in your throat.

{"text":"Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year-old previously right, now left-handed man with a history of complex cardiac disease s\/p open heart surgery at age ___, left MCA stroke in ___ with residual global aphasia, and recent right MCA infarct in ___ who presents following an episode of unresponsiveness. Exam on admission was notable for his baseline global aphasia, R>L weakness and spasticity, with perseveration and inattentiveness, all of which are apparently at baseline. The episode of decreased responsiveness followed by confusion that progressively improved over time certainly raised the possibility of a post-ictal state, though reportedly he was observed all morning, with overt signs of convulsive activity beforehand. His family does also note occasional episodes where he was staring, but seemed unresponsive, which could also suggest seizure activity. Given his multiple prior strokes, these certainly could serve as possible seizure foci. He is on Coumadin, with an INR of 2.7, making new embolic infarct unlikely (and would also be unlikely to cause this time course and pattern of symptoms) and had a NCHCT at the OSH which per official report showed no signs of hemorrhage. Neurology: He was placed on bedside EEG monitoring, which showed no signs of epileptiform activity. It was thought that these episodes of decreased responsiveness were mostly behavioral in nature. He was seen by psychiatry, and it was recommended that he stop the Buspar, and start on Celexa. This did appear to improve his mood and ability to interact. CV: The patient was continued on his Coumadin for his atrial fibrillation. After starting Celexa his INR did increase slightly, so his Coumadin dose was decreased. On discharge his INR was 3.0, and his current Coumadin dose was decreased to 1mg. His INR should be followed closely, as he adjusts to the new medication combination. Exam on discharge was notable for severe global aphasia. He is perseverative, often repeating the same word over and over, and will not reliably follow commands.

A heart related cause was ruled out with testing, however another test showed that you had too much lactic acid. This is usually a seroius sign that your body is not getting enough oxygen. Thus, you spent a night in the ICU. It was discovered also that your blood sugar was far too high. Accordingly, your lactic acid may be the result of uncontrolled diabetes and the pill (metformin) you were using to treat it. We followed your labs and you gradually improved. At the same time, you were able to receive radiation therapy. You were discharged with a new diabetes treatment regimen: NEW Lantus 20 units in the morning NEW Glypizide 5 mg twice a day NEW Bactrim - to prevent a lung infection when on steroids STOP Metformin HOLD Ezetimibe, Fenofibrate - discuss instead starting a statin (such as simvastatin) with your primary care doctor.

On admission to the MICU unit, a Levophed drip was started, more NS was administered and her MAP and CVP responded. On ___, the patient was weaned off levophed. She remained relatively normotensive throughout the remainder of her MICU stay, and was eventually transferred to the general medical floors on ___. The pt. had one episode of severe hypotension to 60mmHg SBP accompanied by altered mental status several days after being transferred to the general medical floor. This occurred after delivering 20 mg of Lasix the day prior for severe shortness of breath secondary to pulmonary edema. Additionally, the pt's O2 sats dropped to the mid 80's and ABG's were performed which showed CO2 retention. The pt. was stabilized with fluid boluses and O2 nonrebreather. At this time, her medication list was re-evaluated as it contained multiple centrally acting sedating medications (medication addendum listed below). The pt. was normotensive for the remainder of her stay. . #. Hypoxia: Pt was admitted with significant hypoxia. Right lower lung exam and CXR findings concerning for pneumonia. Fever, leukocytosis with neutrophilic predominance, and increased sputum production supportive as well of a pneumonia. Sputum notably pink and mucoid in appearance. Per recent chest CT, the patient also had some atelectasis and mucoid impaction which likely contributed to her presenting hypoxia. Broad spectrum antibiotics, vancomycin and zosyn, were initiated to treat hospital acquired pneumona. On ___, after persistent hypotension despite treatment, ciprofloxacin was briefly initiated to provide double coverage for pseudomonas. Ciprofloxacin was discontinued on the same day after infectious disease consult advised low probablity of success with cipro after zosyn resistance identified. On ___, Zosyn was discontinued as cultures were vancomycin sensitive. Chest physical therapy was performed throughout her stay and the patient required oxygen supplementation (4 liter nasal canula)at the time of transfer from the MICU. The patient was given 10mg IV lasix on ___ and ___ to diurese the patient after CXR demonstrated evidence of fluid overload. On transfer to the floor, the pt. had oxygen saturations persistently in the low 90's. Sputum cultures were MRSA positive, and the pt. was continued on Vancomycin. She had an episode of severe respiratory distress several days after transferring to the general medical floors. The pt. had crackles on exam, and she was given 20 mg of Lasix to relieve her pulmonary edema. Additionally, she was put on O2 NRB, then weaned to ___ L NC. The following day, the pt's blood pressure dropped and she experienced aother episode of hypoxia (as outlined above). She was bolused fluids, put on NRB, and weaned to 4L NC. At this time, her medication list was also reevaluated (as above) as her MS\/pulmonary performance was waxing and waning since her return from the MICU. After her medication adjustments, the pt's O2 demands slowly improved until discharge where she was doing well breathing room air. . #. Altered mental status: Patient initially presented with altered mental status thought to be likely toxic-metabolic given infection, hypoxia and hypotension. An ABG taken on ___ showed CO2 of 56 suggesting carbon dioxide retention and mental status changes secondary to hypercarbia. However, review of records demonstrated chronic hypercarbia with pCO2s in ___. Altered mental status largely resolved throughout her stay in the MICU.

No abdominal pain or diarrhea. He had a CXR which indicated an opacity in the left lower lobe. He was initially given ceftriaxone, azithromycin and vancomycin in the ED. Blood cultures from day 1 showed GNR 4 out 4 bottles which eventually were found to be klebsiella. He was given a regimen of cefipime and levofloxacin due to PNA and bacteremia. The source was unknown but possibly from his mouth, from the surgical altered biliary tree or pneumonia\/opacity seen on his CXR. He had an abdominal CT to rule out any collection\/infection associated with his recent whipple. Of note, his CT abdomen, as well as abdominal US showed evidence of left intrahepatic biliary ductal dilatation. The finding was discussed with his surgeon at ___ who indictated that these changes are expected post-whipple. There was no abscess or fluid collection. Given his bacteremia, a TTE and TEE were done to better visualize his valves and rule out any vegetations. The initial TTE was negative for vegetations.

A repeat CT showed increased mediastinal\/hilar adenopathy from known Hodgkins disease, with post-obstructive consolidation in left upper and right middle lobes. Interventional pulmonology was consulted for potential bronchial stenting. They reviewed the imaging and her medical history, and felt that the airways involved were too small to stent safely, particularly given her significant CAD\/PCI history and need for Clopidogrel. She was started on broad antibiotics at the OSH for concern of post-obstructive PNA, but this was narrowed then ultimately discontinued as she remained afebrile, without any respiratory distress and stable O2 requirements. She was started on methylpredisolone at OSH for question of COPD flair. She is started on a taper to be continued on discharge. Due to her ongoing hypoxemia, she is being discharged home on supplemental Oxygen. She and her family are counseled extensively on safety of home O2 use, given that the patient continues to smoke.
