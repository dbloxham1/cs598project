{"index": 4, "question": "Brief Hospital Course: ICU Course: Mr. ___ was admitted to the Neurologic ICU. His blood pressure was kept >140 with norepinephrine and his was kept lying flat to maximize his cerebral perfusion. His exam did improve over the first 24 hours of admission but he did have persistent left sided weaknes, facial weakness and some EOM abnormalities. He did not have any worsening of his exam and BP parameters were broadened to goal >120. This allowed to wean off of pressors. The HOB was slowly increased as tolerated. He was eventually able to sit up without any changes in his exam. He had initially been started on a heparin gtt, but upon further assessment of his risks of GI bleeding and this stopped and he was started on aspirin. The etiology of Mr. ___ stroke is thought to be a result of his dolicoectatic basilar artery. CTA demonstrated a reduction in size of the previously known basilar thrombus/plaque. Mr. ___ had stopped his aspirin roughly a month before presentation due to GI bleeding which may have increase his stroke risk. MRI was consistent with infarction of the anterior right cerebellum and right basis pontis. Risk factors were assessed, LDL was 101 and he was started on atorvastatin. When the patient no longer required norepinephrine for blood pressure support and his exam was unchanged with changing position, he was transferred to the neurology floor. Prior to transfer the patient became febrile and was found to have pneumonia. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for coverage of HAP. Floor Course: Mr ___ was transferred from the ICU to the floor once he was stabilized. He had a Speech and Swallow evaluation and was cleared for thin liquids and soft, moist solids. His antibiotics were discontinued after three days as he remained afebrile with no evidence of respiratory distress. He was otherwise stable throughout his floor course. We continued him on his midodrine and continued to hold his lisinopril in order to keep his blood pressure slightly elevated to allow for adequate CNS perfusion. He can slowly transition off of his midodrine and back to his home lisinopril as tolerated with goal SBP 140-160.", "summary": "You were admitted to the Neurologic ICU for a stroke likely caused by a basilar artery issue. Your blood pressure was managed with medications, and you were started on aspirin and atorvastatin. You were transferred to the neurology floor after stabilization. You developed pneumonia but responded well to antibiotics. You had a Speech and Swallow evaluation and were cleared for certain foods. You were kept on midodrine to maintain blood pressure for CNS perfusion. You will transition back to your home lisinopril as tolerated."}

No evidence of infection on exam, imaging, or lab work. She was treated supportively with pain control. She underwent video swallow evaluation, which was negative for aspiration. She was discharged on roxicet for pain control and a diet of soft solids/thin liquids. # Cough: Worse over the last week with increased sputum production requiring increased suctioning. This is all occurring over the same time period during which she has had pain with swallowing and the sensation that she is aspirating on liquids and foods. Most likely cause of her cough is penumonitis, as there was no evidence of pneumonia visulaized on CXR. # Dehydration: On presentation to the ED there was concern for dehydration in the setting of poor PO intake. She was given 1 L NS in the ED. Following IVF rehydration her labs were normal. She was tolerating a soft diet with thin liquids on discharge. CHRONIC ISSUES: # Asthma: No active issues on this admission. She was maintained on her home albuterol nebs and inhalers. #GERD: No active issues on this admission.

{"index": 6, "question": "Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ year old gentleman with a PMH of HTN, HLD, CAD s/p CABG, hypothyroidism, vascular dementia, hypertensive encephalopathy, recent admissions for spinal surgery and encephalopathy, now with increased dyspnea (lying flat and with activity), productive cough, and confusion s/p outpatient empiric CAP treatment, thought to likely be due to fluid overload. ACTIVE ISSUES: # Acute on chronic diastolic CHF: Dyspea and cough on presentation most likely secondary to a CHF exacerbation, although HCAP was considered. Given symptoms while lying flat and prior cardiac history, acute on chronic CHF seemed most consistent. No EKG changes; troponin elevated to 0.11-0.12; CK-MB flat. CXR's on admission and several days later were consistent with volume overload. Acute systemic infection could cause worsening in cardiac function. Last TTE ___ showed EF 60% with normal global function and normal wall thickness. Patient had a TTE on ___ showing mildly decreased EF from his last TTE of 45-50%, mild lateral hypokinesis, and signficant pulmonary hypertension. Pt was seen by Cardiology consult team who felt that, upon review of the TTE, the echo demonstrated minimal wall motion abnormality but marked increase in severity of mitral regurgitation and pulmonary artery hypertension. Patient has extra fluid removed by ultrafiltration at dialysis. Pt's weight after his last session of dialysis in the hospital (on ___ was 63.7kg but still noted to be fluid overloaded. His new dry weight is likely still lower than this (may be 61kg or even lower). Would encourage further dialysis sessions to continue to challenge him with fluid removal. He required no supplemental oxygen at the time of discharge. . # Concern for HCAP: Despite symptoms consistent with CHF, patient also received several days of empiric coverage for healthcare-associated pneumonia. He presented with symptoms of productive cough, dyspnea lying flat and with exertion, confusion, and initially, CXR read could not exclude consolidation. Given recent hospitalizations and failed improvement on outpatient Cipro, possible PNA would be HCAP. His CURB-65 score was 2 with points for confusion and age. Patient was initially started on vanc/aztreonam because of PCN allergy history (on review of past records, patient was treated with cephalexin in ___ for wound infection, so would likely tolerate a cephalosporin). This was modified to vancomycin/cefepime, then weaned to cefpodoxime/doxycycline, then finally discontinued after three days of antibiotics, as he was afebrile without a leukocytosis or clear consolidation for the course of his admission. He was also treated with Duonebs and encouraged to use IS. . # Hypertension: Patient with history of hypertension, but not on any antihypertensives for the past several admissions at least. Has elevated systolic and diastolic pressures here, probably somewhat attributable to volume overload. Was started on amlodipine 5 mg PO daily with good response in blood pressure. Dialysis team was able to remove some fluid by ultrafiltration. Cardiology team suggested switching amlodipine to ACEI for afterload reduction, but pt has history of hyperkalemia with lisinopril in the past (though did not seem to be on dialysis at that time). Renal consult team was okay with initiating lisinopril, but decision was deferred to outpatient Cardiologist. . # Hypophosphatemia: Phos has been low during this admission. His sevelamer carbonate 3200 mg TID and sevelamer carbonate 1600 mg PO PRN snacks were held during the admission and upon discharge. If restarted as an outpatient, would consider decreasing dose to 1600 mg TID. . # Acute Delirium - Pt has had intermittent confusion during this hospitalization due to unclear cause. He was on Mirtazipine as an outpatient which was discontinued upon admission, in case this was contributing to his admission. Could be due to his symptoms of fluid overload, and pt has not been sleeping well since admission, despite trazodone. His B12 and TSH are normal. It is likely that getting him back to a familiar (environment) where he can sleep normally will help him greatly. . CHRONIC ISSUES: # ESRD: ESRD on HD (___). Continued Nephrocaps, cinacalcet and folic. Held sevelamer as above. Would encourage further fluid removal as above. Should be getting EPO 5,000 units subcutaneously every ___. . # Atrial Fibrillation: In NSR now, rhythm-controlled with amiodarone. INR was supratherapeutic on ___ to 3.8 and so coumadin was held that day, but by ___, it had come down to 2.8, and so was restarted on his home warfarin 2 mg PO daily. He was continued on his amiodarone throughout his stay. . # Macrocytic Anemia: Baseline ___, currently stable. Likely secondary to underlying ESRD. B12 and folate wnl. . # CAD: Pt continued on statin as below. Cardiology consult team recommended initiation of aspirin 81mg daily. Pt is anticoagulated on coumadin, and so deferred decision to initiate aspirin to outpatient cardiologist. . # HLD: Pt was continued on home simvastatin 10 mg daily . # s/p Spinal Surgery: Pt free of pain during hospital course. Continued acetaminophen 1 g TID standing. . # Hypothyroidism: Last TSH in our system was in ___ and was 2.6. Continued Levothyroxine 25 mcg daily. . # Depression: Continued Celexa 40 mg Daily.
