{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: Mr. ___ is a ___ with history of HCV cirrhosis complicated by ___ status post orthotopic liver transplant in ___ on tacrolimus with abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss who was found to have diffuse mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy, a new hepatic lesion, and colonic masses consistent with post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder. << Active Issues: #Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder: In the setting of gastrointestinal symptoms and unexplained weight loss, abdominal CT on admission demonstrated a new right hepatic lobe mass (necrotic- or complex-cystic-appearing on ultrasound), extensive mesenteric and retroperitoneal adenopathy, and a suspicious ascending colonic abnormality; neck and chest CT were negative for adenopathy, and hepatic MRI corroborated the presence of a new hepatic mass, as well as 2 concerning renal lesions. Subsequent colonoscopy was notable for a large polypoid non-obstructing mass on the ileocecal valve with friable mucosa and easy bleeding, another large non-obstructing mass in the ascending colon, and multiple polyps throughout the ascending colon with easy bleeding. Intraprocedural pathology ultimately confirmed the presence of high-grade Non-Hodgkin B-cell monomorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder with high MIB-1 index (___) in the absence of EBV seropositivity. He received CHOP beginning ___ and rituximab ___, followed by Neupogen 480mcg SC daily through his nadir and Humalog insulin sliding scale while on high-dose prednisone. Repeat abdominal CT following R-CHOP demonstrated interval reduction in tumor burden. Although he tolerated CHOP well, he desaturated to 89% on RA in the setting of rituximab infusion, prompting temporary discontinuation and administration of hydrocortisone, Benadryl, and famotidine, permitting resumption of the infusion at a reduced rate. While he required up to 6L NC oxygen over the course of the infusion, he was weaned successfully within hours of completion, without recurrent supplemental oxygen requirement throughout the remainder of admission. To minimize the risk of colonic perforation, he was placed on bowel rest with TPN administration in the context of his chemotherapeutic regimen; although he experienced intermittent abdominal pain, with relief from oxycodone, he displayed no signs of an acute abdomen throughout admission. He was able to tolerate a regular diet by the time of discharge. Prior to initiation of chemotherapy, uric acid peaked at 12.4, with improvement on renally dosed allopurinol. Potassium was intermittently elevated, peaking at 5.9, prompting occasional Kayexelate administration, with good effect; potassium nadired at 2.8 in the absence of aggressive repletion on TPN, given concern for tumor lysis, with likely contribution from concurrent insulin use, with normalization following more aggressive repletion. A right-sided Portacath was placed prior to discharge in anticipation of his second cycle of R-CHOP on ___. #Febrile neutropenia: He developed temperature to 101.3 on CHOP C1D12, prompting initiation of vancomycin and cefepime in the presence of PICC line. Urine culture was contaminated, blood cultures showed no growth, CXR was unremarkable, and CT chest/abdomen/pelvis was negative for acute infection. He completed a 5-day course of empiric vancomycin and a 6-day course of empiric cefepime, without recurrence of fever and discontinuation following resolution of neutropenia. #HCV cirrhosis status post orthotopic liver transplant: He remained on tacrolimus throughout admission, with reduction from 2mg PO q12h to 1.5mg PO q12h and ultimately 1mg PO q12h to meet goal level of ___ per hepatology. Although HCV and CMV viral loads remained undetectable throughout admission, HBcAb was found to be positive in association with negative HBsAg and HBsAb and undetectable HBV viral load, with possible confounding in antibody detection following rituximab infusion. At the suggestion of hepatology, lamivudine 100mg PO daily was initiated for HBV prophylaxis. Home Bactrim prophylaxis also was continued throughout admission. Close hepatology follow-up was arranged in the outpatient setting. #Acute kidney injury: Creatinine was found to be 3.1 on admission, up from recent baseline of 1.0, with prior history of chronic kidney injury (creatinine 1.3-1.5) attributed to tacrolimus. In the setting of urinary symptoms, renal ultrasound demonstrated mild left hydronephrosis without obvious source of obstruction. Urine cultures grew alpha hemolytic colonies consistent with alpha hemolytic Streptococci versus Lactobacillus, for which he received a 7-day course of empiric Augmentin. Following IV hydration and treatment of urinary tract infection, creatinine returned to baseline of ___ by the time of discharge. #Hyper/hyponatremia: Sodium peaked at 150 in the setting of bowel rest and high-dose prednisone use, likely reflecting osmotic diuresis from hyperglycemia in the absence of access to free water, with resolution following discontinuation of IV normal saline in favor of IV half-normal saline, but subsequent gradual downtrend to 129, with resolution following reinitiation of IV normal saline and resumption of regular diet. #Chest pain: He experienced intermittent left chest pain when lying on his left side, which he attributed to PICC placement. Post-placement CXR demonstrated appropriate positioning, with repeat CXR in the setting of pain demonstrating continued appropriate positioning. EKGs obtained in the supine position and when he was lying on his left side were negative for acute ischemic changes. Pain ultimately resolved without dedicated intervention. #Dyspnea: He experienced occasional subjective wheeze, with improvement following albuterol and/or ipratropium nebs; home albuterol inhaler and Combivent were held on admission. Although he does not carry a formal diagnosis of asthma/COPD, he was prescribed inhalers post-transplant. Further evaluation, including ___ be indicated in the outpatient setting. << Inactive Issues: #Hypertension: He remained normotensive on home amlodipine and metoprolol. << Transitional Issues: - Close hematology follow-up is scheduled for administration of cycle 2 of R-CHOP on ___ in the outpatient setting, with ultimate plan for 6 cycles total. Premedication is advised prior to future rituximab infusions, given desaturation in the setting of his initial infusion. - Close hepatology follow-up is scheduled in the outpatient setting; at the request of hepatology, he received a script for outpatient labwork, including tacrolimus level, on ___, with follow-up by ___, liver transplant coordinator. - In the event of continued respiratory symptoms, further evaluation, including ___ be indicated in the outpatient setting. - Full code.", "summary": "As you recall, you were admitted for abdominal pain and kidney injury.

After observation here, it does seem that the spells are precipitated by standing up even in the absence of orthostatic changes, which makes a cardiac etiology more likely; given this, I am most concerned that his lightheadedness is due to excessive beta-blockade.

We've also arranged for you to see a neuro-ophthalmologist as an outpatient, and you have an upcoming heart ultrasound (ECHO) to check on your heart health.\n\nDuring your stay, there was a brief issue with low blood sugar, but it was quickly resolved, and you don't need insulin as you don't have diabetes. Your blood sugar levels are now stable.\n\nWe've recommended you take a week off work to rest and recover. Please make sure to follow up with Dr. ___ within a week to check on your vision and overall recovery, and to get the all-clear to return to work. If you have any concerns or questions, we're here to support you."}

Pt will be bridged on full dose ASA to coumadin. He has a hypercoagulability panel pending, but the most likely source of his stroke was a clot forming in his hypokinetic apical aneurysm. On repeat echo, there was no additional clot in the apical aneurysm, and for this reason, as well as some mild blush of tPA seen on CT scan on initial post-tPA eval, he was not put on a heparin bridge. # CARDS: We started patient on Toprol XL, (which he had been on ___ year ago as an outpatient, but has stopped because of side effects), because patient had occasional runs of NSVT on tele while an inpatient.

He had a witnessed aspiration event on his way to the CT scanner at the time of his stroke. Therefore, it was assumed that his fever was secondary to aspiration PNA, which was confirmed with verbal report ___ radiology. He was started on vancomycin and zosyn on ___ and was planned to receive an 8 day course (to finish ___. In order to make patient's dosing regimen easier, he was sent home on vancomycin and ertapenem. A PICC line was placed so that pt could go home with his IV antibiotics. Of note, patient had a UCx result that showed gram positive bacteria, but the accompanying U/A was unremarkable. We felt that this was likely a contaminant, but we repeated the U/A (again unremarkable) and the UCx (stil pending). These will need to be followed up on at pt's PCP ___ appointment. # PULM: Extubated to room air within 1 day of stroke without complication, but then developed aspiration PNA (see above) so we continued vanc and zosyn with transition to ertapenem prior to dispo. # MSK: CK elevated to 1800's at peak, then trended down throughout the admission. Unclear source. Chart reviewed to ensure no chest compressions were given when pt collapsed, which they were not. No reports of pt fighting the vent, and cardiac enzymes were negative except for CK. We therefore do not have a very good explanation of the elevated CK. Patient was kept on IVF to protect his kidneys and told to remain hydrated when he went home. # RENAL: Cr mildly elevated on ___, likely ___ volume depletion because of poor PO intake and diarrhea from ABx. We put patient on IVF and his Cr quickly improved back to baseline. We told patient to avoid dehydration in the future. # HEMATOLOGY: pt with microcytic anemia. This will need further outpatient workup, but was not addressed in the setting of patient's acute issues. # ENDO: no hx of DM2, but FSs were mildly elevated initially after stroke. He was put on an insulin sliding scale, but his FSs improved without any other intervention and he was sent home off of any medications to control his blood sugars. # GI/NUTRITION: we started pt on omperazole 20mg QD given hx of gastritis and recent GERD sx, as well as imodium PRN diarrhea because he was having GI upset from his ABx. # CODE: Full Code PENDING LABS: UCx final sensitivities ___ BCx x2 ___ UCx ___ Hypercoagulability Panel ___ TRANSITIONAL CARE ISSUES: Patient will need his INR followed to ensure that he remains therapeutic.

Let's go over the key points from your stay:\n\n1. **Fainting Episode (Syncope):** You experienced a fainting spell that was initially thought to be related to your heart's rhythm not being properly regulated. After adjusting your heart device settings, it was discovered that a specific obstruction in your heart might actually be the cause. You'll be following up with your cardiologist to address this.\n\n2. **Kidney Function (ARF):** Your kidney function showed a temporary decline, likely due to dehydration. After receiving fluids, your kidney function returned to normal. It's important to note that your usual pain medication (NSAIDs) was stopped because it might affect your kidneys.\n\n3. **Troponin Levels:** There was a slight increase in a heart-related enzyme, but tests ruled out any heart attack. This was likely related to your temporary kidney issue.\n\n4. **Head Injury:** After a fall, you had a head injury, but scans showed no serious damage. A cut on your scalp was treated with staples, which will be removed at your follow-up appointment.\n\n5. **Blood Pressure:** You had a brief episode of low blood pressure, which was resolved with fluids. Your regular blood pressure medications have been restarted.\n\n6. **Spinal Stenosis and Pain Management:** Your usual pain medications were paused because they might have contributed to your fainting.

Initial exam was notable for mild distention, hypoactive bowel sounds without significant TTP. CT in the ED showed thickening of the bowel wall and evidence of a dilated loops of bowel and increased stool burden consistent with possible SBO. Patient was disimpacted and subsequently had multiple bowel movements, and her abdominal pain improved. She also underwent a paracentesis (___) with 2 L removed with some relief as well. We felt that her pain was likely due to a combination of constipation and pressure from large volume ascites. She was soon able to advance her diet to a regular diet without any nausea or vomiting. We educated the family to reduce the amount of loperamide she was receiving; however, given her underlying neuroendocrine tumor that leads to diarrhea, she did develop 8 episodes of diarrhea on the day of discharge, so she was given 1 dose of immodium prior to discharge. Her family is aware that they can continue the immodium sparingly to avoid constipation. She will follow up with Dr. ___ Dr. ___ in ___ clinic. Of note, we tried to facilitate her getting a depot injection of octreotide while admitted (she is due for her qmonthly injection), but this medicine was not available in the pharmacy and she could not get the injection. # Large volume ascites 2 L removed during therapeutic paracentesis. Diagnostic paracentesis showed transudative fluid without signs of SBP. Given transudative nature and dilated biliary ducts, likely due to liver disease secondary to the liver masses rather than a malignant effusion. Previous paracentesis showed negative cytology, and the cytology from this paracentesis was pending on discharge. To prevent accumulation of fluid, she was started back on Lasix 20 mg, but at a reduced frequency of 20 mg every other day. # Severe Malnutrition: Noted to be cachectic with severe muscle wasting on exam, which likely represents malnutrition in the setting of chronic illness. Our nutrition team was consulted and recommended Regular (low Na) diet and Ensure Enlive TID with meals, which she should continue at home. # Metastatic Low Grade Neuroendocrine tumor: # Biliary dilation # Elevated Alk phos/GGT CT showed large volume ascites and biliary dilation concerning for possible obstruction, particularly in the setting of metastatic neuroendocrine tumor. Though no liver lesions noted on CT abd/pelvis. She is s/p TACE procedure on ___. She has been tolerating octreotide well with some improvement in chronic diarrhea. She was due for octreotide LAR 30 mg on ___ which was not available in the hospital, so she was given 100 mcg SQ, which was NOT an adequate dose, and she will still require the 30 mg LAR dose on discharge. She required a post-TACE MRI liver which was done on ___ and showed \"Innumerable hepatic lesions, with multiple new arterially enhancing lesions, some of which are visualized on the most recent prior CT but many of which are better visualized on the current examination. Multiple hypoenhancing lesions likely represent treated metastases, some of which have decreased in size, but others of which have grown. Findings are suggestive of mixed pattern treatment response, with overall worsening in burden of disease.\" # Bacteuria UA on admission showed large leuks and nitites suggestive of a UTI; however patient is asymptomatic and urine culture returned contaminated with mixed flora. She received one dose of ceftriaxone which was then held on discharge. #Diarrhea: Most likely due to underlying neuroendocrine tumor.

It was unclear which antibiotics patient received prior to admission, though seems she was given cipro and flagyl by ___. She has documented cipro and PCN allergies, making antimicrobial selection for her cholangitis difficult. Both Cipro and PCN allergy are listed as hives, potentially portending a true allergy. However, it based on review of our records, she received cipro and flagyl for ___ days in ___ while at ___ without incident. Per my review of ___ records (paper and online), no BCx drawn from ___ ED visit, so it is unlikely we will have organism grow for definitive abx selection. Our BCx drawn on ___ and ___ remained NGTD till discharge (and have now finalized as no growth). She was initially treated with IV aztreonam and did well. She was transitioned to oral doxycycline (per discussion with our ID team), as tetracyclines should provide appropriate coverage for community acquired organisms that would cause cholangitis, and patient is relatively lower risk for recurrent invasive infection now that she is s/p successful ERCP.

The ERCP team should contact her to arrange this. . # Delirium ___ toxic/metabolic encephalopathy in the setting of cholangitis. Overall is much improved from admission. On the day of discharge was was close, but not quite fully back to her baseline (which her daughter reports is mildly forgetful). I explained to her daughter that I did not feel the patient would be safe staying completely by herself until her mental status returned back to baseline. Her daughter agreed, and planned to take the patient to the patient's home to get clothes/dentures/glasses etc., and then bring the patient back to the daughter's home, where she will have supervision, for the next several days until she was back to her baseline. . # Narrow complex tachycardia, ?Afib: responsive to diltiazem. The patient reports no history of any arrhythmia in the past, feels that metop succinate is for HTN. This was thought to likely be due to severe acute infection (cholangitis) vs. acute allergic reaction to IV ciprofloxacin.

Continued on Bactrim and Valgancyclovir PPx. # Hyponatremia/Acidosis - resolved with IVF. CHRONIC PROBLEMS: # GERD: On Maalox, Sucralfate, and Simethicone. # CAD s/p stent, s/p AAA repair: Patient with SSCP/heartburn during this admission, serial EKGs with no acute changes. CE were negative. Patient continued on home Plavix and Simvastatin. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Campath infusions MWF, over 6 hours, with premedications 30min prior", "summary": "You were admitted to the hospital because you developed chills, nausea, and disorientation following an infusion of alemtuzumab (Campath). We believe this was a reaction to the infusion, and the symptoms passed quickly. However, future infusions caused a rash, so we, along with experts in allergy, developed a strategy to deliver the Campath in a manner you can tolerate. After you tolerated this infusion, you were ready to go back to your rehabilitation facility.", "empathy_summary": "Hello Mr. ___,\n\nI hope you're feeling a bit better today. I wanted to go over what happened during your recent hospital visit to make sure everything is clear.\n\nYou were admitted because you experienced nausea and chills after receiving a Campath infusion, which is part of your treatment for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL). These symptoms were related to the infusion. Initially, you were given medications like Tylenol, Benadryl, and Hydrocortisone to help manage these reactions, but you developed a rash, which can happen with this medication.\n\nTo help prevent this in the future, we'll be adjusting your premedication routine and extending the infusion time. You'll now have premedications 30 minutes before your Campath infusions, which will now take place over 6 hours, every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. This should help make the treatment more comfortable for you.\n\nYour CLL treatment seems to be working well, and we'll keep monitoring your progress. We also resolved an issue with low sodium levels in your blood during your stay. \n\nIn terms of ongoing care, we'll continue with your current medications for your other conditions like GERD and heart health. \n\nPlease feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. We're here to support you every step of the way.\n\nTake care and stay well."}
{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: ___ y/o full code male, resident of ___, with mechanical aortic valve secondary to Listeria endocarditis (on coumadin), Coombs positive autoimmune hemolytic anemia (warm autoantibody, on prednisone), CAD s/p NSTEMI ___, CKD stage III, chronic CHF (likely diastolic with EF 50%), and history of GIB, who presented to the ___ ED with weakness and was noted to have a hematocrit of 19 and melena on guaiac exam. # Acute on chronic anemia/hct drop. Chronic anemia with baseline Hct ___ secondary to warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (on prednisone, managed by heme/onc), stage III CKD, and myelodysplasia. Acute hematocrit drop to Hct 16 was initially suspected to be from UGIB vs. LGIB given melena on guaiac exam (especially considering his history of esophageal erosions/gastritis/lymphangiectasias). Differential also included acute on chronic hemolysis from his warm hemolytic anemia. He was hemodynamically stable in the ICU. He received vitamin K with improved INR, a total of 4 units of PRBC, was initially placed on an a pantoprazole drip which was later transitioned from IV to PO omeprazole 40mg BID. He received an upper GI endoscopy that did not reveal an active source of bleeding, a non-bleeding duodenal polyp and a small hiatal hernia were found. He continued on ___ iron, folate, MVI, and alternating prednisone of 20 mg and 15 mg. Heme/Onc and GI were consulted. He was transitioned to a PO diet which he tolerated upon discharge. # CAD/left arm pain. Likely result of demand ischemia given acute drop in Hct, there were no ST/T changes on EKG and although his troponin level was mildly elevated on discharge, it trended down and his pain resolved with oxygen improvement of his anemia. He was continued on ___ simvastatin. # Aortic mechanical valve, on coumadin. Goal INR 2.5-3.5. He was found to have INR 5.9 on admission, coumadin was held and he received 5mg PO vitamin K in the ED with reversal of his INR to 2.2 in the setting of a potential GI bleed. Due to this rapid reversal, there was suspicion that the initial INR was a laboratory error. He was placed on a heparin drip (mechanical valve) and was restarted on coumdain on ___. He will continue on heparin drip until INR is at goal 2.5-3.5. # Autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Heme/Onc was consulted. He continued with ___ prednisone regimen and was started on bactrim for PCP ___. # Stage III CKD: Slight acute on chronic renal failure, likely secondary to hypovolemia in setting of anemia. Resolved and creatinine returned to baseline with improvement in his hematocrit and volume status. # Subclinical Hypothyroidism: TSH was normal. He continued with ___ levothyroxine dose 75 mcg daily. # Tinea corporis: Topical Clotrimazole was started for likely tinea on his right foot. This should be continued for 7 days. The patient was full code for this admission. His son was his point of contact. He will be discharged to ___ where he will continue on heparin drip and his INR should be checked daily. A CBC should be checked in 1 week to ensure his anemia and thrombocytopenia is stable.", "summary": "You came to the hospital because you were anemic (your blood counts were much lower than normal) and we suspected possible bleeding from your gastrointestinal tract. You had an upper endoscopy which did not show any source of bleeding. You also have an autoimmune disease which causes you to be anemic, this disease was also likely contributing to your lower blood counts. You received several units of blood, you improved, and were stable for transfer back to your assisted living. Due to your anemia, we stopped your coumadin and you are temporarily on heparin. We are restarting your coumadin and once your INR is at goal, the heparin will be stopped.", "empathy_summary": "Hello,\n\nI hope this message finds you well. During your recent hospital stay, we addressed several health issues, and I want to ensure you understand what happened and how we're moving forward.\n\nYou came to the emergency department feeling weak, and tests showed your red blood cell levels were quite low, which can make you feel tired and weak. This was partly due to your ongoing condition called autoimmune hemolytic anemia, where your body mistakenly attacks its own red blood cells, and possibly a minor stomach bleed. We managed to stabilize your blood levels with a blood transfusion and special medications.\n\nWe also found that your blood thinner levels (INR) were higher than they should be, which could increase bleeding risks. We adjusted your medication and gave you vitamin K to bring it back to a safer level. You will continue with your blood thinner at home, and we'll keep a close eye on those levels.\n\nRegarding your heart, you experienced some discomfort possibly due to the stress on your body from the low blood levels. Fortunately, this resolved as your condition improved in the hospital.\n\nOther issues like your kidney function and a minor skin infection were also treated and improved before you left the hospital.\n\nYou will continue some medications at home and have routine checks to ensure everything stays stable. It's important to follow up with your healthcare providers, keep track of your blood levels, and take your medications as prescribed.\n\nIf you have any questions or feel unwell, please don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare team or visit the hospital.\n\nTake care, and we wish you a smooth recovery."}
{"text": "Brief Hospital Course: Ms. ___ is a ___ y/o female with history of chronic pancreatitis s/p partial pancreatectomy, cholecystectomy, and splenectomy, and poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus who presents with abdominal pain concerning for chronic pancreatitis flare. #Abdominal pain: Patient presented with a few days of upper abdominal pain radiating to her back with associated vomiting and diarrhea. The patient is confident that this is similar to prior episodes of pancreatitis. Her exam was remarkable for generalized tenderness without signs of acute abdomen, and her exam remained stable throughout her stay. It slightly improved with symptomatic management. Lipase was normal which was consistent with her prior presentations, though unlike prior presentations, her other LFTs were also unremarkable save for an elevated alk phos. The patient did meet SIRS criteria based on heart rate and leukocytosis, though her white count appears to be chronic and has been attributed to her splenectomy. She did not have any fevers or chills. Cholangitis was ruled out with normal LFTs; other etiologies of mid-epigastric pain have been considered including gastritis, ulcer disease, AAA, and infection, though they were less likely at this time. Her hyperglycemia was likely exacerbating her symptoms as elevated sugars can worsen GI motility. She did have some diarrhea during this stay, but she endorses alternating constipation and diarrhea at home, and this was not significantly different than baseline. She was able to tolerate a regular diet at the time of discharge. She was continued on a low-fat, low-residual diet, with her supplementary dietary enzymes (Zenpep). Her pain and her nausea were addressed, and she should continue on her home pain regimen as well as her home anti-emetic regimen. #Hyperglycemia, diabetes mellitus type II, uncontrolled: Patient with long history of diabetes mellitus that has been poorly controlled. Her last A1c was 11.5% in ___. The patient is seen at ___ by Dr. ___. She reports hyperglycemia beyond baseline for the past several weeks. She was seen at ___ on ___ at which time she was started on 25 units of U500 three times daily with sliding scale. However, with the syringe she has been using, this dose is actually 125 units of U-500 TID. Her blood glucose in the ED was 545; she was continued on her home regimen, and ___ on the floor were in the 160s. She was seen by ___ who suggested she simply continue on her pre-admission regimen. She should continue on her home 125 units U-500 TID, in addition to her home Pioglitazone and Metformin. She has close follow-up scheduled on ___ with ___, at which time her insulin can be further adjusted if necessary. #Hyponatremia: Sodium was 126 on presentation, but when corrected for blood glucose was noted to be 133. Her chloride was also low on initial presentation which was somewhat suggestive of volume depletion; she recevied 3L IVF in the ED which did not continue on the floor. #Leukocytosis, chronic: The patient has had a chronic leukocytosis attributed to her history of splenectomy. Some component of her leukocytosis may represent hemoconcentration as her HCT was borderline high. Patient remained afebrile throughout her stay, and her abdominal exam continually improved. She was tolerating a regular diet at the time of discharge. Lipase was WNL. Bloodstream, pulmonary, or urinary tract infections were not acute concerns at this time. #Hypertension: Patient was continued on her home Clonidine and Losartan. #Chronic pain, complex regional pain syndrome: Patient has significant generalized pain at baseline. She was continued on her home Lidocaine patch, her home Gabapentin regimen, and home Tizanidine. Her home Tapentadol was held ___ as it is non-formulary, but she can resume previous use of this medication upon discharge. #Insomnia: Patient was continued on her home Doxepin. TRANSITIONAL ISSUES: - Patient should follow-up with ___ for insulin adjustment.", "summary": "You were admitted due to abdominal pain, which was originally concerning for pancreatitis. Your lab numbers were normal, and your pain improved throughout your stay. You did not receive any imaging. After taking your home enzymes, you were able to tolerate a full meal. Your sugars were also found to be high; you were seen by the ___ doctors ___, who wanted you to continue on your current insulin regimen.", "empathy_summary": "Hello Ms. ___,\n\nYou recently visited the hospital with abdominal pain, which you thought was a flare-up of your chronic pancreatitis. After careful evaluation, it seemed similar to your previous episodes. The medical team managed your symptoms, which helped you feel slightly better, and they ruled out other possible causes of your pain like infections or gallbladder issues. \n\nYour diabetes, which has been difficult to control, was also a focus during your stay. Your blood sugar levels were quite high, and this might have been making your symptoms worse. You're on a specific insulin regimen that you should continue at home, and there is a follow-up appointment scheduled to adjust your insulin as needed.\n\nYou were also found to have a slightly low sodium level, which was corrected with fluids while you were in the emergency department. Your blood tests showed a high white blood cell count, which is expected due to your past surgery to remove your spleen.\n\nRegarding your chronic pain, the hospital continued your usual medications to help manage it, and you can restart one of your pain medications that wasn\u2019t available during your stay now that you\u2019re home. \n\nLastly, your blood pressure and sleep medications should be continued as usual. Please remember to follow up with your healthcare provider for any necessary adjustments to your treatment plan.\n\nTake care, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns."}
