Given a detailed and jargon-heavy hospital note (from the "text" field), write a concise, emotionally intelligent summary that a patient can understand.
Vary the tone based on severity:

- If itâ€™s a minor issue (e.g., flu, mild infection), be straightforward and reassuring.
Your goal is to be clear, kind, and helpful.
